Chicago has had Light Rail (above ground subway) since the late 1800's, and Louisville still does not sadly!!! 

HISTORY OF THE L
Beginning in the 1870s, as Chicago grew at an incredibly rapid pace, private companies laid rail tracks downtown and began introducing streetcars pulled by horses. In the 1880s, these horse-drawn trolleys were replaced by cable car services. But this form of transportation couldn‚Äôt handle a high volume of passengers and it added to street congestion.

On June 6, 1892, the first elevated‚Äîor ‚ÄúL‚Äù‚Äîtrain ran from 39th (now Pershing Road) and State streets to Congress Parkway and Wabash Avenue. By 1893, the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad extended this line to Jackson Park, the site of the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition of 1893. Today, this section of track is still part of the Green Line.

Multiple privately-operated train lines transported Chicagoans in the 1890s. However, these trains deposited people just outside the central business district‚Äîan area referred to as ‚Äúthe Loop‚Äù due to the cable cars that once created a loop around several blocks. A wealthy and controversial financier named Charles Tyson Yerkes soon changed all of this. Despite his sometimes illegal business practices, he had a lasting impact on Chicago by building elevated tracks above downtown streets to connect train lines together. Yerkes essentially created the Loop L we know today.

The first full circuit of the Loop was completed in 1897. Its steel structure was designed by bridge designer John Alexander Low Waddell. The iconic riveted steel-plate form resembles that of the Eiffel Tower (1889) and the original Ferris Wheel (1893).

All of Chicago‚Äôs trains were either elevated or at street grade until the 1940s. With funding from the Federal Works Agency‚Äîpart of President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal‚Äîthe State Street Subway, now part of the Red Line, opened in 1943. The Dearborn Street Subway, now part of the Blue Line, opened in 1951, following a construction delay during World War II. https://youtu.be/Sbq8uf25KWc?si=ssmwqb76ZzsmrSG5

The estimated cost to build the East End tunnels in Prospect, Kentucky was $338 million in 2014. The tunnels were part of the Kentucky approach to a new bridge. 
Explanation 
The tunnels were twin, two-lane tunnels that would carry traffic to and from the new bridge.
The tunnels were built under the Drumanard property, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The tunnels were part of the Ohio River Bridges Project, which cost $242.34 million in total.

The Background Story

Plans for an East End bridge date back to at least 1969. Part of the problem with building it has long been that the Kentucky approach to this bridge would pass through the town Prospect, arguably the Louisville area‚Äôs most affluent and influential suburb. (For readers in Central Indiana, think ‚ÄúZionsville‚Äù or Southwest Clay Township in Carmel and you‚Äôll have the picture). The wealthy and influential residents there were long able to stymie progress on the East End bridge. They also had an ally in Louisville major Jerry Abramson, who greatly feared a beltway connection that would allow traffic to bypass downtown Louisville. He promoted a new downtown bridge instead.

In the grand tradition of political compromise, Indiana and Kentucky agreed to build both bridges. This was in part possible because of a city-county merger in Louisville, which reduced the fear of downtown lobby because they would still control revenues from any East End growth the bridge might spawn. Hence was born the fiction of ‚Äútwo bridges, one project‚Äù even though there is no real transportation necessity to link the two and either one has independent utility.

But the Prospect residents were never going to give up. As part of their plan to kill the East End bridge, they managed to get the Dumanard Estate put onto the National Register of Historic Places to make it much more difficult to route a roadway through it. After the original listing that included the home and gardens, the listing was later expanded to include the entire 55-acre grounds.

If you are wondering how building two bridges got to be $4.1 billion in the first place, this is an example of how. To avoid impacting this single historic property, Kentucky agreed to build a $261 million tunnel underneath the estate. (LEO Weekly discussed this in an article called ‚ÄúThe $260 Million Home.‚Äù)

The stunning thing about this tunnel is that the path of the road doesn‚Äôt actually affect any buildings, as this graphic from Broken Sidewalk illustrates:

If spending $260 million on this sounds ludicrous to you, then you are getting a sense of why Indiana shouldn‚Äôt be touching it with a ten foot pole.

A few readers were discussing Louisville‚Äôs old light rail proposal circa 2002 called Transportation Tomorrow (T2), so I decided to post the old renderings and route map in case anyone else needed a refresher.

From the project abstract at the U.S. DOT‚Äôs Context Sensitive Solutions site:

Travel and congestion in the South Central Corridor have dramatically increased due to population and employment growth within the Louisville Metropolitan Area (LMA). An important indicator of congestion has been growth in trips on I-65 that neither begin nor end in the LMA, but are ‚Äúthrough trips‚Äù on the interstate system. The combined travel on I-65 for local, regional and through trips has resulted in slower and less predictable travel times and reduced mobility for many interlocking travel markets in the South Central Corridor. Accessibility to jobs, business establishments, and cultural, entertainment, institutional and public service destinations is deteriorating and is considered a primary limiting factor to social and economic development. Neighborhoods are affected by the diversion of some longer trips to the local street system. Existing bus transit operates in mixed traffic and experiences the same congestion as a private automobile. In most circumstances, the rising congestion penalizes the transit traveler more so than the automobile traveler when both in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle travel times are taken into consideration. Existing transit, therefore, does not, and cannot, effectively compete with the single occupant vehicle (SOV).

But what has happened to the T2 light rail proposal since then? From TARC‚Äôs FAQ page: What happened to Light Rail?

The Light Rail project began with a Major Investment Study in 1996. After initial studies and analysis, rapid transit was prioritized over other alternatives and the locally preferred South Central Corridor was selected. The project entered into the Federal New Starts Program, and it was approved as a project in Horizon 2030, the region‚Äôs long-range transportation plan. The project then moved into Preliminary Engineering after the FTA issued a ‚Äòrecommended‚Äô rating and the draft environmental impact statement was completed. In 2004 ‚Äì 2006, the FTA implied that the movement into Final Design was not possible without a secured local match and the Draft Environmental Statement was not released for public review. At this point, TARC withdrew the Transportation Tomorrow project from New Starts program due to the inability to secure local funding.",2025-02-07T14:18:32.000Z,0.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,True,0.9936,positive

AJC,"In New York City, a congestion pricing toll covers the Central Business District in Manhattan. Passenger and small commercial vehicles pay $9 once per day that they enter the zone in peak hours (5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends) and $2.25 in non-peak times. Motorcycles pay less and certain bigger trucks and buses pay more. Taxis get a discounted rate per trip.

So, would something like that work in Atlanta?

In a press release, MTA shared that the new pricing system made for 219,000 less vehicles in that congestion zone in the first week, compared to that week a year prior, meaning traffic volume was down 7.5%.

MTA has not yet been able to correlate higher ridership on buses and trains with the new tolls. For one, tens of thousands of people already use the system, which is far more reliable and dense than MARTA in Atlanta.

AJC,"Channing Baker, a fourth-generation contractor, is now a roofing subcontractor for the Centennial Yards project and was among the roughly 500 construction workers who celebrated the Dec. 18 topping out of Hotel Phoenix, the second building to reach its highest point within the 50-acre redevelopment.

The construction milestone allowed the workers to enjoy viewing the fruits of their labor ‚Äî the latest high-rise joining Atlanta‚Äôs skyline.

The $5 billion redevelopment between Mercedes-Benz Stadium and MARTA‚Äôs Five Points station is among the most challenging construction projects in the Southeast and involves the collective work of thousands.

The hotel and its sister apartment tower, called the Mitchell, are expected to open in 2025, becoming the first new buildings erected from the Gulch with several others under construction.

In metro Atlanta, some areas have seen about 2 to 3 inches of snow. 

The snow storm has impacted Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the busiest airport in America, with multiple cancellations and delays. Thus far, 616 flights have been canceled and a ground stop has be until noon. 

In terms of school closings, Atlanta Public Schools, Fulton County Schools, Cobb County Schools, Clayton County Schools, and DeKalb County Schools have all announced closings and cancellations of activities.

Remember to follow us @theurbanatlanta for all things development news!üëáüèΩ

A new 646 million dollar fleet of 56 modernized trains is set to debut in July 2025. Manufactured by Stadler Rail, the sleek CQ400 model features futuristic-looking four-car sets with open gangways for easier movement, and improved accessibility for bikes, strollers, and wheelchairs. 

MARTA also announced this week that it‚Äôs investing $500 million in a state-of-the-art train control system to improve safety, on-time performance, and efficiency. The new system will work seamlessly with the new trains, replacing the older 1970s cars. Testing is taking place in Salt Lake City, with the first trains scheduled for service in about half a year‚Äôs time. 

One cool aspect: the front of each vehicle will be lit with LED colors that correspond to each rail line. 

Ya‚Äôll excited for this?

Louis Escareno,"Bravo Judge Rosie Speedlin Gonzalez bringing focus to domestic violence in San Antonio and recognized by the New York Times. 

One City‚Äôs Attempt to Change How Domestic Violence Is Tackled
San Antonio has long had a high rate of family violence. An unusual court is trying to intervene before the violence turns deadly.

By Edgar Sandoval
Reporting from San Antonio
New York Times
Dec. 3, 2024, 5:00 a.m. ET

On a sweltering July night, Jesse Falcon was so high on cocaine, marijuana and alcohol that he would later say that he barely remembered the explosion of violence that happened.

Convinced that his girlfriend was pursuing another man at a social gathering at their apartment complex in San Antonio, he began attacking the man. When his girlfriend tried to intervene, he shoved her so hard that she was left with a gash on her arm.

Mr. Falcon, 21, did recall one thing about the evening: ‚ÄúI was full of rage,‚Äù he said.

Cases like Mr. Falcon‚Äôs are troublingly familiar to court officials in San Antonio, which has long been plagued with a high rate of domestic violence. ‚ÄúThey leave jail angrier and more resentful, and the trauma continues,‚Äù said Rosie Speedlin Gonzalez, a family violence judge in the city.

A court run by Judge Gonzalez is trying a different approach: providing the abusers with a chance to change.

First-time offenders like Mr. Falcon can avoid becoming another statistic in the long string of men ‚Äî and a growing number of women ‚Äî who go to jail for hurting their families, if they are accepted into a family violence diversion program run by Judge Gonzalez‚Äôs court, which is known as Reflejo, Spanish for reflection.

The problem is hardly unique to San Antonio, a Latino-majority metropolis in South Texas. Much of the country saw a record spike in domestic violence cases during the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns, job losses and alcohol consumption drove people into tense situations indoors.

Many cities have tried to address the problem, and rates in several cities are declining once again. San Antonio is among the places that have assigned more detectives to domestic violence cases. It is also conducting ‚Äúlethality assessments,‚Äù in which officers ask a series of questions to determine whether a victim is in danger of serious violence or even death if an intervention does not occur.

But the city felt an urgency to do even more. San Antonio has consistently ranked among the top 20 large cities for rates of aggravated domestic violence ‚Äî higher than Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Atlanta, according to a survey by the Council of Criminal Justice that was released in October. San Antonio also stood out for having a large share of underreported incidents, said Alex Piquero, a professor of criminology at the University of Miami who was one of the study‚Äôs lead authors.

The new court is one of a handful across the country that provide incentives as well as accountability for perpetrators, aimed at helping them control violent impulses before they become deadly.
In exchange for seeing their charges expunged, offenders who appear in Judge Gonzalez‚Äôs court are required to complete an intensive program of frequent court appearances, counseling, treatment for addiction and random drug and alcohol testing.

On a recent afternoon, Mr. Falcon and a group of men who had all been arrested at one point for assaulting a romantic partner or a household member gathered in the judge‚Äôs chambers. Mr. Falcon soon found himself answering uncomfortable questions. A monitor he was required to wear had detected alcohol in his system, a violation of the program‚Äôs rules that could send him back to jail.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go a long way if you re-examine your steps,‚Äù Judge Gonzalez said, shooting him a stern look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young. I want to see you do great things.‚Äù

This year, the nine family violence homicides in Bexar County, the unincorporated area around San Antonio, surpassed the number in each of the past three years, according to the county sheriff‚Äôs office. The city of San Antonio has also seen a troubling rise in domestic violence cases.

In 2019, the escalating number of cases prompted hundreds of people, many of them women, to descend on a town-hall meeting where they described chokings, beatings and other episodes of violence committed regularly, mostly by men in their families.

A judge ordered the creation of a commission on domestic violence to help address the problem.

Abusers tend to come from poor neighborhoods and often numb the memories of their own childhood traumas with substance abuse, said John Vacca, who runs a class known as Pathways to Healing, a requirement for those in Judge Gonzalez‚Äôs program.

Mr. Vacca, who served time in jail for gang-related offenses as a young man, today tries to help people recognize the triggers that lead them to violent outbursts. On a recent evening in a community center, Mr. Vacca welcomed several people who are part of the court‚Äôs program and made eye contact with Mr. Falcon, who sat in the front row, wearing a shy smile. Mr. Vacca wrote down two words on a chalkboard: Anger. Healing.

‚ÄúNobody teaches you about confusion ‚Äî it‚Äôs the beginning of anger, escalating to rage,‚Äù Mr. Vacca said as he paced in front of them. ‚ÄúOnce you feel that confusion coming up, that‚Äôs your warning signal.‚Äù
For Judge Gonzalez, who works closely with Mr. Vacca, the idea of a court like Reflejo seemed like common sense. Even before being elected as a judge in 2018, she said, she had grown frustrated while working as a lawyer and a social worker; there seemed to be a revolving door of people who were continually rearrested for assaulting a loved one.

‚ÄúMany reoffend, not knowing why,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt understand where these emotions are coming from.‚Äù
When she started pitching the idea of a program for abusers, not victims, she was met with resistance. One politician told her, ‚ÄúNobody wants to help a violent offender ‚Äî it‚Äôs bad politics,‚Äù Judge Gonzalez recalled.

Legislation to create the court, written with the help of the judge‚Äôs wife, Stacy Speedlin Gonzalez, a scholar who has been open about her own struggles with abuse and domestic violence, was sponsored by two local lawmakers and signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2019. The court began in earnest a year later.

The court has since graduated 35 offenders, with only one of them being rearrested so far. Judge Gonzalez said she was aware of only two similar courts, one in Ohio and another in Florida.

It is hard to measure whether the program has worked where it matters most: inside families. Women who had a partner participating in the Reflejo court declined to be interviewed about it.

And not everyone agrees with its methods. Marta Pelaez, who runs Family Violence Prevention Services, an organization that runs a shelter and works to reduce family violence, said she found it hard to believe that an abuser could heal long-held, violent traits in a ‚Äúmatter of weeks.‚Äù Real change comes after years, if not a lifetime, of treatment, she said.

‚ÄúAnything that is close to 90 percent I‚Äôm very suspicious of,‚Äù Ms. Pelaez said, citing the court‚Äôs success rate. ‚ÄúIt is not possible to shift your attitude that dramatically. It would take years and years for a person to shift.‚Äù

Still, Mr. Falcon said he believed that without the Reflejo court, he would still be abusing drugs and making poor decisions. In the past year, he said, he has learned to regulate his emotions and follow rules. ‚ÄúAt the beginning it was hard to stay positive,‚Äù Mr. Falcon said. ‚ÄúBut I am glad I have stayed on track. I realized that they only want the best for us.‚Äù

He said the therapy had helped him think about the role his own family history played in his life. He was raised by a single mother who struggled to support the family with a job as a waitress. His father was in and out of prison. And he had faced relentless bullying at school, with classmates often making fun of his weight by mooing while he waited in line in the cafeteria, sometimes hitting him, he said.

Years later, he said, he found himself lashing out at the people he cared about, but had no idea how to seek help. ‚ÄúAs Hispanics, it is very difficult to talk about emotions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt seek therapy. It was very stigmatized.‚Äù

The other men in the program shared similar stories. Shawn Sullivan, 37, said he was 10 when he was forced to clean the area where his grandfather had just shot his step-grandfather in the head.
James Nicholson, 30, recalled that his mother, who struggled with mental illness and alcoholism, slapped him so hard when he was 4 years old that he lost several teeth.
They had paid it painfully forward: Mr. Sullivan said he was arrested after getting into a physical fight with a former boyfriend. Mr. Nicholson was arrested after striking his wife in what had begun as a petty fight.

At times, some of the people in the program falter.
Deonte Hawkins, 23, a friend of Mr. Falcon‚Äôs who is also enrolled in the program, was taken into custody recently after missing some of his required substance abuse meetings.

For that hearing, Judge Gonzalez had called in Mr. Hawkins‚Äôs wife to sit next to him. She sobbed uncontrollably as the judge tried to reason with him.
‚ÄúGive us some insight because we are at a loss,‚Äù the judge told Mr. Hawkins. ‚ÄúWe want to help you. Is that what you want, to hurt her like that? You love her, right?‚Äù

Mr. Hawkins lowered his head. His wife dried her tears and watched as court officers handcuffed him and took him away. Judge Gonzalez later said that Mr. Hawkins was doing better and had gotten back on track.

Walking out of court that day, Mr. Falcon said he did not want to find himself in his friend‚Äôs shoes. He said he had found a good job working as a barista at a coffee shop, and, while he was not thinking about starting a family anytime soon, he was not ruling it out for later. First, he said, he would have to do a little more growing.

‚ÄúMy attitude toward life has changed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know how to respond to situations now. I‚Äôm a different person.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the things that Andrew Young brings to conversations is hope,‚Äù Franklin said Friday. ‚ÄúHe sees the upside. He sees the possibilities even in times of trouble.‚Äù

Atlanta‚Äôs transportation system may not have ever existed if it wasn‚Äôt for Young. The Former mayor was instrumental in rallying voters to pass a mass-transit referendum that only succeeded by a few hundred votes. While serving in Congress, Young helped channel millions in federal dollars to MARTA.

Work to transform the transit system‚Äôs busiest station was slated to begin in July, but MARTA paused the project after Mayor Andre Dickens, city officials, and riders opposed plans to close the station and reroute buses.

Dickens also questioned the cost of the project following a city audit and expressed concerns over the station being closed during the World Cup 2026 matches set for nearby Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Rep. Saira Draper,"GA Representative @votesaira knows more about voter protection in Georgia than *anyone*. She‚Äôs worked as the director of voter protection for the Democratic Party of Georgia and the Georgia director of voter protection for the Biden 2020 campaign. Here‚Äôs what she wants you to know:

- VOTE EARLY: Not only is early voting easier (more locations to vote and shorter lines), but it helps prevent chaos on Election Day itself. Many of the new regulations are designed to make voting take longer. On Election Day, expect long lines to vote.
- CHECK YOUR REGISTRATION: Over 100,000 voters have been removed from voter rolls. Check your status and register before tomorrow. 
- GET INVOLVED: Come to the State Election Board meeting on October 8th at 9:00am in room 341 at the Capitol in downtown Atlanta. Park in the Pete Hackney parking deck or take MARTA.
- LOCAL ELECTIONS MATTER: Local elections impact your daily life more than the presidency. Vote down the ballot.

At the end of last year, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority dumped two railcars off Georgia‚Äôs coast as part of a program to develop reef habitats and marine wildlife with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Reef Project. Any hazardous materials were removed first, and they were inspected by the US Coast Guard.

In August, the DNR Coastal Resources Division made its first dive to check on the cars and discovered soft coral beginning to grow and at least nine species of game fish.

11Alive News,"The Atlanta City Council has approved new ordinances that could significantly reshape the city's core by restricting where data centers can be developed. The legislation, which bars new data centers from being built near the BeltLine and within a half-mile of MARTA stations, is designed to prioritize human spaces over industrial use.

Atlanta's data center market has been one of the fastest-growing in the nation, driven by increased demand for digital infrastructure. However, city leaders are concerned that these developments could encroach on valuable urban space that is better used for public amenities.

The new restrictions will take effect once Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens signs them.

11Alive News,"The State Transportation Board of Georgia approved the selection of a private sector partner for the Georgia 400 Express Lanes Project on Thursday. This allows the Public Private Partnership project to move forward, according to a release. 

In general, the project will add new express lanes in both directions along an approximately 16-mile section of Georgia 400 from the North Springs MARTA Station (Exit 5C) in Fulton County to approximately one mile north of McFarland Parkway (Exit 12) in Forsyth County. Like existing express lanes in the state, the new one will have variable-priced tolls that allow drivers to bypass congestion.

National Association of Home Builders (NAHB),"The NAHB Awards Program is now accepting applications and that including the Best in American Living Awards. Take a look at one of last year's winners, a gorgeous development for students in Atlanta, Georgia.

When you can‚Äôt build out, build up. This thoughtfully considered tower rises 25 stories to take full advantage of its half-acre footprint within walking distance to Georgia Tech‚Äôs campus in the heart of Tech Square, Midtown Atlanta‚Äôs hub for startups and research centers.

Whistler offers 565 beds in 168 units and features more than 17,300 square feet of boutique-style amenities. Students can treat themselves to craft coffee and artisan pastries at the on-site Daydreamer cafe, exercise in the expansive fitness center with yoga and spin studios, or lounge poolside on the rooftop deck while enjoying panoramic skyline views.

The 284,839-square-foot property is served with one level of basement parking totaling 25 spaces to encourage a continued reliance on biking, walking, scooters and public transportation with proximity to Atlanta‚Äôs MARTA lines. The dynamic design of mid-gray tones starts with a stacked base of amenities to activate the street, and draws the eye up with slender, mini towers and rhythmically shifting balconies slightly offset from each other to create a dynamic facade instead of a static block.

Whistler accomplishes the city‚Äôs initiative to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment, while providing students unmatched amenity spaces and views of the city and campus.

11Alive News,"Atlanta's Five Points MARTA station could soon have limited access to complete a four-year renovation project, despite protection and even a request from the mayor.

According to the transit system, travelers will be closed to the hub coming off the street beginning July 29. While trains will continue to run through the station, allowing passengers to transfer, there will be limited access to elevators. 

This would hinder riders with disabilities, who would then need to use MARTA Mobility shuttles to change direction, adding to their commute.

Black History Moments,"Let's take the time out to wish civil rights activist and Pastor Andrew Young a happy birthday today! Andrew Jackson Young (born 03/12/1932) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Daisy Fuller Young, a school teacher, and Andrew Jackson Young, Sr., a dentist. Young's father hired a professional boxer to teach Andrew and his brother how to fight, so they could defend themselves. Young graduated from Howard University and earned a divinity degree from Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1955. Young was appointed to serve as pastor of a church in Marion, Alabama. It was there in Marion that he met Jean Childs, who later became his wife. Young became interested in Gandhi's concept of non-violent resistance as a tactic for social change. He encouraged African-Americans to register to vote in Alabama, and sometimes faced death threats while doing so. It was at this time that he became a friend and ally of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1957, Young and Jean moved to New York City to accept a job with the Youth Division of the National Council of Churches. While in New York, Young regularly appeared on Look Up and Live, a weekly Sunday morning television program on CBS, produced by the National Council of Churches in an effort to reach out to secular youth. Young moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1961, and again worked on drives to register black voters. In 1960, he joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Young was jailed for his participation in civil rights demonstrations, both in Selma, Alabama, and in St. Augustine, Florida. Young played a key role in the events in Birmingham, Alabama, serving as a mediator between the white and black communities. In 1964, Young was named executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), becoming, in that capacity, one of King's principal lieutenants. As a colleague and friend of Martin Luther King Jr., he was a strategist and negotiator during the Civil Rights Campaigns in Birmingham (1963), St. Augustine (1964), Selma (1965), and Atlanta (1966) that resulted in the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. He was with King in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated in 1968. In 1970, Andrew Young ran as a Democrat for Congress from Georgia, but was unsuccessful. After his defeat, Rev. Fred C. Bennette, Jr., introduced him to Murray M. Silver, an Atlanta attorney, who served as his campaign finance chairman. Young ran again in 1972 and won. He later was re-elected in 1974 and in 1976. During his four-plus years in Congress, he was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and was involved in several debates regarding foreign relations, including the decision to stop supporting the Portuguese attempts to hold on to their colonies in southern Africa. Young also sat on the powerful Rules Committee and the Banking and Urban Development Committee. Young opposed the Vietnam War, [4] helped enact legislation that established the U.S. Institute for Peace, established the Chattahoochee River National Park and negotiated federal funds for MARTA and the Atlanta Highways. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Young to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Young resigned from Congress, and his seat was taken by Wyche Fowler after a special election. Although the US and the UN enacted an arms embargo against South Africa, as President Carter‚Äôs UN ambassador, Andrew Young vetoed economic sanctions. Young caused controversy when, during a July 1978 interview with French newspaper Le Matin de Paris, while discussing the Soviet Union and its treatment of political dissidents, he said, ""We still have hundreds of people that I would categorize as political prisoners in our prisons,"" in reference to jailed civil-rights and anti-war protestors. In response, U.S. Representative Larry McDonald (D-GA) sponsored a resolution to impeach Young, but the measure failed 293 to 82. Carter referred to it in a press conference as an ""unfortunate statement"". In 1979, Young played a leading role in advancing a settlement in Rhodesia with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, who had been two of the military leaders in the Rhodesian Bush War, which had ended in 1979. The settlement paved the way for Mugabe to take power as Prime Minister of the newly-formed Republic of Zimbabwe. There had been a general election in 1979, bringing Bishop Abel Muzorewa to power as leader of the United African National Council leading to the short-lived country of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Young refused to accept the election's results, and described the election as ""neofascist"", a sentiment echoed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 445 and 448. The situation was resolved the next year with the Lancaster House Agreement and the establishment of Zimbabwe. Young's favoring of Mugabe and Nkomo over Muzorewa and his predecessor and ally, Ian Smith, was, and remains, controversial. Many African-American activists, including Jesse (truncated)",2024-03-13T05:00:00.000Z,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,True,0.9505,positive

Fulton County Government,"Mr. Coy Dumas, Jr. is a native of the Adamsville community of Atlanta, Georgia and in 1972, joined what was then called Atlanta Transit as a bus operator. He has run routes solely in West Atlanta over the past 50 years, and currently operates Route 853 out of the West Lake Station on the Blue Line.
Mr. Dumas has carried approximately 2.8 million passengers on his bus since he began his career in transit. He boasts a spotless driving record over his career and has never had a traffic accident, having driven over two million miles across the City of Atlanta. Now after 51 years of dedicated service to the citizens of Atlanta and Fulton County, he has decided to retire, but continue training new drivers as a consultant.

The Fulton County Board of Commissioners recognizes Coy Dumas, Jr. for his outstanding example of service, dedication, and professionalism with MARTA, and celebrates his retirement after 51 years of service, and does hereby proclaim Wednesday, November 15, 2023 as Coy Dumas Jr. Appreciation Day in Fulton County, Georgia.",2023-11-15T19:11:12.000Z,25.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,True,0.9627,positive

11Alive,"A man who'd been wanted in Atlanta for murder for nearly 28 years was finally caught this week during a routine traffic stop, according to the FBI.

The agency said in a release that Muhammed Bilal El-Amin was captured by the Oconee County Sheriff's Office, near Athens, in the course of the traffic stop.

He'd had a FBI reward out for his arrest since the early 2000s, after allegedly shooting a man in the face with a handgun at the Oakland City MARTA station in Atlanta in November 1994.

Kay James McCrimon,"HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. ANDREW YOUNG JR. (ŒëŒ¶Œë)! Today, March 12th, we celebrate the 91st birthday of Andrew Jackson Young Jr. (March 12, 1932 in New Orleans, Louisiana); an African-American politician, diplomat, and activist. Beginning his career as a pastor, Young was an early leader in the civil rights movement, serving as executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and a close confidant to Martin Luther King Jr. Young later became active in politics, serving as a U.S. Congressman from Georgia, United States Ambassador to the United Nations in the Carter Administration, and 55th Mayor of Atlanta. Since leaving office, Young has founded or served in many organizations working on issues of public policy and political lobbying. Andrew Young was born to Daisy Young, a schoolteacher, and Andrew Jackson Young, a dentist. Young's father hired a professional boxer to teach Andrew and his brother to defend themselves. In a 1964 interview with author Robert Penn Warren for his book, Who Speaks for the Negro?, Young recalls the tensions of segregation in New Orleans, especially growing up in a fairly well-to-do household. He recalls his parents trying to ""compensate for segregation"" by providing for their children but were reluctant to help less wealthy black communities in the area. Young, attended Dillard University for one year before graduating from Howard University. He then earned a divinity degree from Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1955. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Young was appointed to serve as pastor of a church in Marion, Alabama. It was there in Marion that he met Jean Childs, who later became his wife. Young became interested in Mahatma Gandhi's concept of nonviolent resistance as a tactic for social change. He encouraged African Americans to register to vote in Alabama, and sometimes faced death threats while doing so. It was at this time that he became a friend and ally of Martin Luther King Jr. In 1955 he accepted a pastorate at Bethany Congregational Church in Thomasville, Georgia. In 1957, Young and Jean moved to New York City when he accepted a job with the Youth Division of the National Council of Churches. While in New York City, Young regularly appeared on Look Up and Live, a weekly Sunday morning television program on CBS, produced by the National Council of Churches in an effort to reach out to secular youth. Young served as a pastor of the Evergreen Congregational Church in Beachton, Georgia, from 1957 to 1959. In 1960, he joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. No longer satisfied with his work in New York City, Young moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1961 upon the invitation of Bernard Lafayette and worked to register black voters. Young played a key role in the 1963 events in Birmingham, Alabama, serving as a mediator between the white and black communities as they negotiated against a background of protests. In 1964, Young was named executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. As a colleague and friend of Martin Luther King Jr., he was a strategist and negotiator during the Civil Rights Campaigns in Birmingham (1963), St. Augustine (1964), Selma (1965), and Atlanta (1966). He was jailed for his participation in civil rights demonstrations, both in Selma, Alabama, and in St. Augustine, Florida. The movement gained congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Young was with King in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated in 1968. In 1970, Young ran as a Democrat for the 5th District seat in the US House of Representatives, from Georgia, but was unsuccessful. After his defeat, Rev. Fred C. Bennette Jr. introduced him to Murray M. Silver, an Atlanta attorney, who served as his campaign finance chairman. Young ran again in 1972 and won. He later was re-elected in 1974 and in 1976. During his four-plus years in Congress, he was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and was involved in several debates regarding foreign relations, including the decision to stop supporting the Portuguese attempts to hold on to their colonies in southern Africa. Young also sat on the powerful Rules Committee and the Banking and Urban Development Committee. Young opposed the Vietnam War, helped enact legislation that established the U.S. Institute for Peace, established the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area and negotiated federal funds for MARTA and the Atlanta Highways. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Young to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Young was the first African American to hold the position. Atlanta city councilman Wyche Fowler won the special election to fill Young's seat in Congress. Although the US and the UN enacted an arms embargo against South Africa, as President Carter's UN ambassador, Young vetoed economic sanctions.

Georgia Policy,"Some bad ideas never die. MARTA released details last fall on a plan to extend its streetcar 2.5 miles to Atlanta‚Äôs Beltline.

The first line of the Atlanta Streetcar system was implemented in 2015 and has been a terribly inefficient public transit program since its implementation. 

The numbers speak for themselves:

- The cost of the first 2.7 miles exceeded estimates at $99 million, or $36.7 million a mile, in 2015. In 2023, estimated costs ballooned to between $88 million to $107.5 million a mile for the proposed expansion with total project costs ranging from $176 million to $230 million.
- Even when it was free, ridership was significantly below capacity, and now that the line costs $1 a ride, ridership has sunk to an average of 400 riders a day in 2022. 
- The system has an average traveling speed of 5 mph. Considering the average human walking speed is 2.5 to 4 mph, it‚Äôs not unfair to say Atlanta‚Äôs streetcars are one of the slowest forms of public transportation available.

Rather than an expensive project that will serve a limited area and has limited demand by people living there, we should be looking at solutions that are a better fit for commuters of necessity, will actually reduce car usage within the city and be cost effective for taxpayers.

Fulton County Commissioner Natalie Hall-District 4,"Congratulations to Mr. Coy Dumas, Jr., The Department of Real Estate Asset Management, and The Public Works Department on being recognized for your service to City of Atlanta and Fulton County residents. 

The Department of Real Estate and Asset Management (DREAM) has two employees, Benjamin Wright, a Central Fulton Building Maintenance Supervisor, and Patrick Ent, a Greater Fulton Building Maintenance Supervisor, along with Department Director Joe Davis, that worked through the entirety of both County holiday periods, responding to facility issues at 16 buildings. Their response included securing the affected plumbing and fire sprinkler systems, facilitating necessary repairs in conjunction with contractors, and providing daily access to restoration contractors. 

The Public Works Department has a total of 14 employees that worked through the holiday weekend and repaired two major water main leaks, one on Marietta Street in Alpharetta and the other on Haynes Bridge Road in Johns Creek, as well as answered over 130 calls from residents with frozen pipes. Staff assisted homeowners with turning off water to their homes to minimize damage to their properties. 

Mr. Coy Dumas, Jr. is a native of the Adamsville community of Atlanta, Georgia and in 1972, joined what was then called Atlanta Transit as a bus operator. As a native of the Westside, he covered the West Atlanta routes and currently operates Route 853 out of the West Lake Station on the Blue Line. MARTA officials estimates that Mr. Dumas has carried approximately 2.8 million passengers on his bus since beginning his career in transit 50 years ago.

Mr. Dumas boasts a spotless driving record over his career and has never had a traffic accident. He is MARTA‚Äôs most veteran bus driver and wears operator badge #1. He's also been a mentor to countless bus operators over the past five decades, leads the Mentorship Program at the Perry Bus Facility, and he's made no plans to retire. 

 In commemoration of his unprecedented 50 years of dedicated service, Mr. Dumas was honored by the MARTA Board of Directors with a MARTA bus wrapped with his photo.

11Alive,"A man who'd been wanted in Atlanta for murder for nearly 28 years was finally caught this week during a routine traffic stop, according to the FBI.

The agency said in a release that Muhammed Bilal El-Amin was captured by the Oconee County Sheriff's Office, near Athens, in the course of the traffic stop.

It was not clear how deputies tied El-Amin to the 1994 crime during the traffic stop.

He'd had a FBI reward out for his arrest since the early 2000s, after allegedly shooting a man in the face with a handgun at the Oakland City MARTA station in Atlanta in November 1994.
