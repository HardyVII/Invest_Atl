Rough Draft Atlanta,"Just three weeks after Lucian Books & Wine received a semifinalist nod for Outstanding Wine Program from the James Beard Foundation, owners Jordan Smelt and Katie Barringer announced they will open Sargent next spring along the Eastside Beltline. 

Named for American portrait artist John Singer Sargent, the couple‚Äôs second Atlanta restaurant will become the latest edition to the New City development in the Old Fourth Ward. The sprawling Beltline complex is also home to MailChimp, plant shop The Victorian, Burle‚Äôs Bar, and the Forth Hotel with its restaurants Il Premio, Elektra, Moonlight, and Bar Premio.

Located in a ground floor space beside 3 Parks Wine Shop and seating around 150 people, Sargent will feature a full bar serving cocktails, an expanded retail section selling books, a private dining room, and a covered patio. Expect wood-fired dishes influenced by American cuisine from Lucian executive chef Jason Paolini and a wine list from Smelt leaning heavily into domestic producers. ‚û°Ô∏è Read more about Sargent at the link in bio.",2025-02-12T22:03:53.000Z,477.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,True,0.6124,positive
AJC,"Doctors recommend walking, but for many Atlantans, it‚Äôs too dangerous.

Researchers at Arizona State University were actually able to prove that being forced to drive everywhere is making Americans unhappy. But experts say the inadequacy of Atlanta‚Äôs biking and walking infrastructure not only creates dangers for pedestrians but also affects the overall health of the city‚Äôs residents.

And although Atlanta‚Äôs Beltline project has vastly improved walkability in several parts of the city, only 25% of the city‚Äôs population lives near it, according to The Conservation Fund.

Rough Draft Atlanta,"The Atlanta Beltline has purchased a shuttered Buckhead nightclub where it plans to build a key segment of the Northwest Trail.

On Thursday, Mayor Andre Dickens and Atlanta Beltline Inc. President and CEO Clyde Higgs announced the acquisition of the Elleven45 Lounge at 2110 Peachtree Road NW. The Beltline acquired the roughly one-acre site for $11 million.

The controversial nightclub was the scene of a fatal shooting in the early morning hours of May 12. Two people were killed and two wounded. One arrest was made in the shooting. The city of Atlanta shut the nightclub down months later after a Fulton Superior Court judge ruled the venue a public nuisance. 

The nightclub property was needed to complete Segment 2 of the Northwest Trail located near Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, the largest employer in the Beltline Planning Area.

This segment is a 0.7-mile stretch being built outside the railroad corridor starting at the southwest corner of Bobby Jones Golf Course, running east along Colonial Homes Circle, and then passing under Peachtree Road. A construction date for Segment 2 is not yet known.
