AJC,"Hundreds of runners from local running groups gathered at the Atlanta Beltline’s West End Trail Sunday for a memorial run five years after Ahmaud Arbery’s murder.

Arbery's mother was in attendance and thanked them “for continuing to run with Ahmaud.”

“Typically as you move further from tragedy, it grows further from the mind, but I’m encouraged people still care and people continue to come out and show support,” said J.R. Hughes, a member of the South Fulton Running Partners. “Ahmaud’s life still means something to people.”

Thousands nationwide also participated with a promise that people have not forgotten the 25-year-old Black man, who was chased down and killed while jogging near Brunswick.

Atlanta Magazine,"💖🐱🏮 One of the Reasons We Love Atlanta: Because the Lantern Parade founder threw her cat a funeral and the whole neighborhood came out. “I had made a puppet of Rex a few years earlier that was in several parades,” says Chantelle Rytter. “He had a little kitty fan club. So when he passed [in 2021], we invited the neighborhood out for a jazz funeral.” ⁠
Her Krewe of the Grateful Gluttons now hosts seven annual events. “Parades are where a community sees itself,” says Rytter, whose Beltline Lantern Parade celebrates 15 years this May. “We like each other better when we see each other in our playfulness. It just does a body good.”⁠ ⁠

Named for American portrait artist John Singer Sargent, the couple’s second Atlanta restaurant will become the latest edition to the New City development in the Old Fourth Ward. The sprawling Beltline complex is also home to MailChimp, plant shop The Victorian, Burle’s Bar, and the Forth Hotel with its restaurants Il Premio, Elektra, Moonlight, and Bar Premio.

Located in a ground floor space beside 3 Parks Wine Shop and seating around 150 people, Sargent will feature a full bar serving cocktails, an expanded retail section selling books, a private dining room, and a covered patio. Expect wood-fired dishes influenced by American cuisine from Lucian executive chef Jason Paolini and a wine list from Smelt leaning heavily into domestic producers. ➡️ Read more about Sargent at the link in bio.",2025-02-12T22:03:53.000Z,477.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,True

AJC,"Doctors recommend walking, but for many Atlantans, it’s too dangerous.

Researchers at Arizona State University were actually able to prove that being forced to drive everywhere is making Americans unhappy. But experts say the inadequacy of Atlanta’s biking and walking infrastructure not only creates dangers for pedestrians but also affects the overall health of the city’s residents.

And although Atlanta’s Beltline project has vastly improved walkability in several parts of the city, only 25% of the city’s population lives near it, according to The Conservation Fund.

“We had so many community members say that they didn’t know the space was down there,” said Chamblee Public Arts Coordinator Teneisha Jones. “So hopefully we will see an increase in usage as well. We are so happy with the results of the mural festival, and working with Babe Walls was a smooth process.”

AJC,"Did you shop Small Business Saturday?

Atlanta Beltline Marketplace partnered with Atlanta Indie Market to feature over 30 small businesses across three different locations on the Beltline this past Saturday.

Small business owners say local markets such as these are essential to their business, especially as the economy has made it more difficult to afford supplies and ingredients, and as such, turn a profit.

Atlanta Indie Market sets up on the Beltline every second Saturday of the month with local vendors, games, buskers and music.

AJC,"The Atlanta Beltline’s vision for its largest piece of property is beginning to take shape.

The Beltline acquired 425 Chappell Rd. three years ago for nearly $26 million from developer Brock Built Homes. The Beltline envisions up to 1,100 residences on the site, with nearly a third reserved as affordable housing, alongside 5,000 square feet of commercial space.

The organization filed paperwork last week outlining a $270 million plan to develop the land. The Beltline estimates the entire development could be finished by 2030.

Atlanta Magazine,"The year is 2013, Atlanta is crawling out from economic recession, and James Beard–nominated chef @chefhectorsantiago has recently closed Pura Vida, his beloved tapas staple in Poncey-Highland. The more Santiago ponders his next move, the more a concept called @poncecitymarket sounds appealing—largely because it would be connected to @atlantabeltline’s brand-new Eastside Trail. “The Beltline brought that kind of cosmopolitan, walking-around feel of a city,” recalls Santiago. “It really changed the city to me. And I wanted to be in the center of it.” As for Santiago, his Ponce City bet paid off. @elsuperpan_pcm, his Latin bar for sandwiches and cocktails, has become a cornerstone (literally, on a can’t-miss corner) of the food hall, and joins original tenants such as @bellinaalimentari, @mineroatl, Jia, and W.H. Stiles Fish Camp, which are still feeding roughly 10,000 daily visitors. Santiago has claimed another corner space for a second concept, tapas bar @lametroatl and he estimates his original fast-casual business tallies 300 orders per day on average. “We have the traffic of being at the airport,” Santiago says. “And every year it grows—well, apart from the pandemic.”⁠

The New York Times,"Atlanta, the de facto capital of the American South, is secure in its position as a nexus of civil rights history, capitalist hustle, Black creativity, and (thanks to generous state tax credits) TV and film production. 

Beyond the traffic-choked highways, Atlanta’s older, more central neighborhoods offer abundant charm, thrumming with dining, nightlife and art. A key catalyst has been the Atlanta Beltline, the partly constructed 22-mile walking and biking path that has connected old parts of town in fresh ways, spurring revitalization and giving locals and visitors alike a place to enjoy the city outside their cars.

Rough Draft Atlanta,"The Atlanta Beltline has purchased a shuttered Buckhead nightclub where it plans to build a key segment of the Northwest Trail.

On Thursday, Mayor Andre Dickens and Atlanta Beltline Inc. President and CEO Clyde Higgs announced the acquisition of the Elleven45 Lounge at 2110 Peachtree Road NW. The Beltline acquired the roughly one-acre site for $11 million.

The controversial nightclub was the scene of a fatal shooting in the early morning hours of May 12. Two people were killed and two wounded. One arrest was made in the shooting. The city of Atlanta shut the nightclub down months later after a Fulton Superior Court judge ruled the venue a public nuisance. 

The nightclub property was needed to complete Segment 2 of the Northwest Trail located near Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, the largest employer in the Beltline Planning Area.

This segment is a 0.7-mile stretch being built outside the railroad corridor starting at the southwest corner of Bobby Jones Golf Course, running east along Colonial Homes Circle, and then passing under Peachtree Road. A construction date for Segment 2 is not yet known.

Rough Draft Atlanta,"@theatlantaopera will transform the historic Bobby Jones Clubhouse into a performing arts center with a recital hall, theatre venue, education spaces, and administrative and rehearsal areas for the Opera.

Located in Peachtree Battle on Woodward Way along the Atlanta Beltline, the facility is expected to cost $45 million with core funding already secured, according to a press release from the Opera. Announcements of the donors and a capital campaign will be announced soon, and the project is estimated to be completed by the summer of 2027.

The long-vacant clubhouse, which served the Bobby Jones Golf Course in Atlanta Memorial Park, was built in the Grecian revival built in the early 1900s.

The 17,000 square foot clubhouse will transform into a 56,000+ square foot complex housing a 200-seat recital hall, administrative offices, a costume shop, a ﬁlm studio, a rehearsal hall, and garden spaces. Theater Projects and A’kustiks, LLC., are developing the recital hall as a premiere venue to present classical singers and musicians, jazz ensembles, lectures and spoken word artists, and other performing arts.

11Alive News,"The Atlanta City Council has approved new ordinances that could significantly reshape the city's core by restricting where data centers can be developed. The legislation, which bars new data centers from being built near the BeltLine and within a half-mile of MARTA stations, is designed to prioritize human spaces over industrial use.

Atlanta's data center market has been one of the fastest-growing in the nation, driven by increased demand for digital infrastructure. However, city leaders are concerned that these developments could encroach on valuable urban space that is better used for public amenities.

The new restrictions will take effect once Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens signs them.

Atlanta News First ,"New bike lanes have caused some confusion for drivers at a southeast Atlanta intersection.

Some motorists turning right onto Memorial Drive from Boulevard are driving into the new lanes meant for cyclists. Concerned residents have shared pictures with Atlanta News First showing cars in the wrong lane.

Cyclists like Ian Wells told Atlanta News First that signage for the lanes would be helpful.

“Signs on Memorial and Boulevard that you’re coming up to a bike corridor,” Wells said. “Like, the Beltline has a lot of signage.”

Tharon Johnson,"I believe the BeltLine is a public good, one which has already transformed our city for the better. Building the BeltLine has, at its core, built new communities and connections in our city, bringing us closer together in a way that I think even the most optimistic projections couldn’t have anticipated.

While division across the country has made big wins more rare, I believe the Atlanta BeltLine shines as a beacon of what is possible when we let our imaginations loose. The first step to rebuilding our divided communities is connecting them, a promise that the BeltLine is on track to fulfill.

We were honored to work alongside @TheBTFoundation and other supporters to provide over 200 Atlanta-area kids with new bikes, helmets, and free bike lessons. Thanks to everyone who came out for the morning’s group ride (featuring some big-time Celebrity Captains) and the afternoon festival. 

We’re already counting down the day’s until next year’s BikeFest!

I have been waiting so long for the grand opening of @vietvana! They opened earlier this month in Atlanta’s West End at @leeandwhite's food hall and I just have to put you on, (no matter how badly I want to keep this one to myself).😉

I’m a stickler for some amazing Vietnamese food and Vietvana truly does not disappoint!

Here’s everything we tried:✨
🍤Shrimp spring rolls
🤤Crispy egg rolls
🍗Vietnamese wings
🍜House-made phở
🥪Handcrafted Bánh mì
🧋Boba smoothies

⭐️PLUS: If you haven’t taken advantage of all this side of town has to offer, you are seriously missing out. You can hop right on the beltline for the nicest stroll, or stop at one of the breweries nearby.🍺

Vietvana:✨
📅Open 7 days a week at Lee + White
🕰️Monday to Saturday: 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Sunday: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Commissioner Natalie Hall of District 4, and The Beauty Industry kicked off the first episode of Women in Atlanta. It was a great conversation about uplifting and inspiring the community and how Women in Atlanta can be a part of the positive success. In this clip, Commissioner Hall discusses her Senior BeltLine Tour. Through her partnership with the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership, Fulton County seniors aged 55 and older are invited to a 3-hour tour of the 22-mile Atlanta BeltLine. This interactive, guided tour not only showcases the BeltLine’s contributions to our communities but also teaches seniors how they can actively participate in BeltLine activities.

Senator Jon Ossoff,"NEWS: Sen. Ossoff, Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock, and Congresswoman Nikema Williams today announced new Federal grants to upgrade transportation & recreation infrastructure for Georgia families — including historic grants to fund phase 1 of The Stitch & a new multi-use trail connecting the AtlantaBeltLine with the Flint River Trail. A $157 million Federal investment will fund Phase 1 of The Stitch project, which aims to reconnect downtown Atlanta by capping the I-75/I-85 interstate with a new 4-acre park and multimodal improvements across the street network with better connectivity to MARTA’s Civic Center. A $50 million Federal investment in the Southside Trail will help advance the Atlanta Regional Commission's project to build a new multi-use trail — which would help connect schools, hospitals, job centers, and MARTA rail between the BeltLine and the Flint River Trail. Sens. Ossoff and Rev. Warnock also announced additional grants for continued planning of projects to upgrade infrastructure across Georgia. The City of Savannah will receive a $1.8 million Federal investment for Savannah's I-16 flyover project, which aims to remove the flyover exit ramp over Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard to Montgomery Street & the associated adjacent ramps to improve connectivity. Athens-Clarke County will receive an $800,000 Federal grant to continue planning infrastructure upgrades along Hawthorne and Oglethorpe Avenues in downtown Athens, improving connectivity and increasing community safety. Macon-Bibb County will receive a $500,000 Federal grant for continued planning of upgrades to the Pleasant Hill Neighborhood, with plans to reconnect the community with Macon-Bibb County’s downtown business district.",2024-03-12T15:30:18.000Z,75.0,9.0,15.0,0.0,True

Georgia Policy,"Some bad ideas never die. MARTA released details last fall on a plan to extend its streetcar 2.5 miles to Atlanta’s Beltline.

The first line of the Atlanta Streetcar system was implemented in 2015 and has been a terribly inefficient public transit program since its implementation. 

The numbers speak for themselves:

- The cost of the first 2.7 miles exceeded estimates at $99 million, or $36.7 million a mile, in 2015. In 2023, estimated costs ballooned to between $88 million to $107.5 million a mile for the proposed expansion with total project costs ranging from $176 million to $230 million.
- Even when it was free, ridership was significantly below capacity, and now that the line costs $1 a ride, ridership has sunk to an average of 400 riders a day in 2022. 
- The system has an average traveling speed of 5 mph. Considering the average human walking speed is 2.5 to 4 mph, it’s not unfair to say Atlanta’s streetcars are one of the slowest forms of public transportation available.

Rather than an expensive project that will serve a limited area and has limited demand by people living there, we should be looking at solutions that are a better fit for commuters of necessity, will actually reduce car usage within the city and be cost effective for taxpayers.

I partnered with Atlanta BeltLine Partnership to bring Seniors a 3-hour tour of the Atlanta BeltLine Westside Trail. The event gave Fulton County Seniors an opportunity to see everything the Westside Trail has to offer. This fun, interactive, guided tour also taught Seniors how they can engage in BeltLine activities.

Bibb County GOP,"Warnock Steered $16 Million to Project That Benefited Co-Owner of Church’s Controversial Apartment Complex—Today, Team Herschel released the following statement highlighting an article from The Washington Free Beacon titled: ""Warnock Steered $16 Million to Project That Benefited Co-Owner of Church’s Controversial Apartment Complex.” Georgia Democratic senator Raphael Warnock steered $16.4 million in federal earmarks to a project that benefited the co-owner of his controversial low-income apartment complex. ""The funding was intended to construct a trail connecting a residential and commercial complex known as ""Pittsburgh Yards"" with other portions of Atlanta's BeltLine. The developer of Pittsburgh Yards is Columbia Ventures, part of the Columbia group of companies that co-owns and operates a low-income housing complex with Warnock's church. ""The funding raises questions about whether Warnock's business relationship with Columbia had any bearing on his funding decision. Warnock did not respond to a request for comment. ""Warnock's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he serves as senior pastor and CEO, in 2005 'formed a partnership with Columbia Residential to rehabilitate [a] dilapidated high-rise' and turned the building into low-income apartments. Ebenezer and Columbia are co-owners of the business through a joint venture, with Ebenezer owning 99 percent and Columbia owning the remaining 1 percent, according to a state grant application filed by the entities in August. ""Last November, Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.) announced that they had helped secure the funding for the trail project, which would 'construct approximately two miles of the Southside Trail component of the Atlanta BeltLine from Pittsburgh Yards to Boulevard Crossing Park.'"" ""Raphael Warnock is a corrupt hypocrite who only cares about himself, not the people of Georgia,"" said campaign spokesman Will Kiley. ""Warnock lines his pockets and the pockets of his allies while attempting to evict low-income tenants in the building he oversees. Since coming to office, Warnock has doubled his income while Georgia families struggle to make ends meet. Raphael Warnock needs to be held accountable by the 'media' and the people of Georgia for his lies.""",2022-11-22T20:12:38.000Z,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,True

---Twenty-three years ago, Atlanta-native and architecture and urban planning student Ryan Gravel had an experience that opened his mind to what urban living could be.
""My senior year I spent abroad in Paris and lived without a car for a year and traveled by train everywhere,"" says Gravel. ""And within a month of arriving, I had lost 15 pounds. I was in the best shape of my life because I was walking everywhere, and the role of the physical city was made clear to me in a way it really had never been before.""
For his Georgia Tech master's thesis, Gravel sketched out a plan to make Atlanta more like Paris. He proposed redeveloping the land along the city's historic rail lines to create a 22-mile loop called the Atlanta BeltLine. He proposed turning the city's abandoned industrial areas and single-family home neighborhoods into business districts and walking trails. And he proposed connecting downtown to the rest of the city all with a new train running along the entire Atlanta BeltLine.
""I never imagined we would actually do it,"" says Gravel.
But they did—for the most part. Cathy Woolard, who was president of the Atlanta City Council, read Gravel's thesis and decided to use it as a blueprint to remake much of the city. Today, the Atlanta BeltLine is a walking and biking trail, parts of which are bordered by retail and condos.
But one piece of Gravel's grand vision didn't get built: The train.
Today, Gravel runs a co-working and event space along the BeltLine, which also serves as a gathering place for urbanists interested in making Atlanta less dependent on cars. He says that the train line is essential for improving city life.
""In those early days, when we built the movement behind the [BeltLine] project, it was around transit,"" says Gravel.
The three COVID relief bills set aside $69 billion in federal funding for local transit agencies to operate and add to their transportation systems, meaning that Atlanta might finally get its train—with many American taxpayers who will never step foot on it picking up much of the tab.
Many American cities have used federal money in the past to build rail transit lines that suffer from dismal ridership, that are expensive to maintain, and that are a major drain on their budgets.

Atlanta (/ætˈlæntə/) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Georgia. With an estimated 2019 population of 506,811,[10] it is also the 37th most populous city in the United States. The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area, home to more than six million people and the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the nation.[8] Atlanta is the seat of Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia. Portions of the city extend eastward into neighboring DeKalb County. The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River.[13]
Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad. With rapid expansion, however, it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The city's name derives from that of the Western and Atlantic Railroad's local depot, signifying the town's growing reputation as a transportation hub.[14] During the American Civil War, the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. However, the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the ""New South"". During the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership.[15] During the modern era, Atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub, with Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport being the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998.[16][17][18][19]
It ranks in the top twenty among world cities and 10th in the nation with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $385 billion.[20][21] Atlanta's economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors that include aerospace, transportation, logistics, professional and business services, media operations, medical services, and information technology.[22] Atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and dense tree coverage, earning it the nickname of ""the city in a forest"".[23] Gentrification of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline, altering the city's demographics, politics, aesthetic, and culture.[24][25][26]

Dr. Fahamu Pécou,"We Can’t Cop Cars Without Seeing Cop Cars” is a site specific installation by artist/scholar Dr. Fahamu Pecou. The installation features a short film by the same title displayed within a modified Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor.
Crown Victoria Interceptors are a popular vehicle used in police forces across the country. When decommissioned, they are repurposed and sold at auto auctions, often purchased by Black men in urban communities. The irony of the Crown Victoria being a popular car amongst Black men can’t be overstated, but the silhouette of the vehicle continues to have a visceral affect.

The project explores the notion of Black leisure by highlighting spaces where Black men can experience freedom, autonomy, and joy. Few representations of Black life depict these images or even considers these as valid experiences. We Can’t Cop… uses cars as an allegorical as well as a literal suggestion of movement and escapism from the stresses and traumas of the world. From fear, to triumph, to joy and back to reality, the short film uses the aesthetics of magical realism to give viewers a momentary glimpse into the complex emotional landscape of Black male masculinity.” Written and Directed by Fahamu Pecou
