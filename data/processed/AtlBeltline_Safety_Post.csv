AJC,"Doctors recommend walking, but for many Atlantans, it‚Äôs too dangerous.

Researchers at Arizona State University were actually able to prove that being forced to drive everywhere is making Americans unhappy. But experts say the inadequacy of Atlanta‚Äôs biking and walking infrastructure not only creates dangers for pedestrians but also affects the overall health of the city‚Äôs residents.

And although Atlanta‚Äôs Beltline project has vastly improved walkability in several parts of the city, only 25% of the city‚Äôs population lives near it, according to The Conservation Fund.

Atlanta Indie Market sets up on the Beltline every second Saturday of the month with local vendors, games, buskers and music.

Atlanta Magazine,"The year is 2013, Atlanta is crawling out from economic recession, and James Beard‚Äìnominated chef @chefhectorsantiago has recently closed Pura Vida, his beloved tapas staple in Poncey-Highland. The more Santiago ponders his next move, the more a concept called @poncecitymarket sounds appealing‚Äîlargely because it would be connected to @atlantabeltline‚Äôs brand-new Eastside Trail. ‚ÄúThe Beltline brought that kind of cosmopolitan, walking-around feel of a city,‚Äù recalls Santiago. ‚ÄúIt really changed the city to me. And I wanted to be in the center of it.‚Äù As for Santiago, his Ponce City bet paid off. @elsuperpan_pcm, his Latin bar for sandwiches and cocktails, has become a cornerstone (literally, on a can‚Äôt-miss corner) of the food hall, and joins original tenants such as @bellinaalimentari, @mineroatl, Jia, and W.H. Stiles Fish Camp, which are still feeding roughly 10,000 daily visitors. Santiago has claimed another corner space for a second concept, tapas bar @lametroatl and he estimates his original fast-casual business tallies 300 orders per day on average. ‚ÄúWe have the traffic of being at the airport,‚Äù Santiago says. ‚ÄúAnd every year it grows‚Äîwell, apart from the pandemic.‚Äù‚Å†

The New York Times,"Atlanta, the de facto capital of the American South, is secure in its position as a nexus of civil rights history, capitalist hustle, Black creativity, and (thanks to generous state tax credits) TV and film production. 

Beyond the traffic-choked highways, Atlanta‚Äôs older, more central neighborhoods offer abundant charm, thrumming with dining, nightlife and art. A key catalyst has been the Atlanta Beltline, the partly constructed 22-mile walking and biking path that has connected old parts of town in fresh ways, spurring revitalization and giving locals and visitors alike a place to enjoy the city outside their cars.

Rough Draft Atlanta,"The Atlanta Beltline has purchased a shuttered Buckhead nightclub where it plans to build a key segment of the Northwest Trail.

On Thursday, Mayor Andre Dickens and Atlanta Beltline Inc. President and CEO Clyde Higgs announced the acquisition of the Elleven45 Lounge at 2110 Peachtree Road NW. The Beltline acquired the roughly one-acre site for $11 million.

The controversial nightclub was the scene of a fatal shooting in the early morning hours of May 12. Two people were killed and two wounded. One arrest was made in the shooting. The city of Atlanta shut the nightclub down months later after a Fulton Superior Court judge ruled the venue a public nuisance. 

The nightclub property was needed to complete Segment 2 of the Northwest Trail located near Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, the largest employer in the Beltline Planning Area.

This segment is a 0.7-mile stretch being built outside the railroad corridor starting at the southwest corner of Bobby Jones Golf Course, running east along Colonial Homes Circle, and then passing under Peachtree Road. A construction date for Segment 2 is not yet known.

Rough Draft Atlanta,"@theatlantaopera will transform the historic Bobby Jones Clubhouse into a performing arts center with a recital hall, theatre venue, education spaces, and administrative and rehearsal areas for the Opera.

Located in Peachtree Battle on Woodward Way along the Atlanta Beltline, the facility is expected to cost $45 million with core funding already secured, according to a press release from the Opera. Announcements of the donors and a capital campaign will be announced soon, and the project is estimated to be completed by the summer of 2027.

The long-vacant clubhouse, which served the Bobby Jones Golf Course in Atlanta Memorial Park, was built in the Grecian revival built in the early 1900s.

The 17,000 square foot clubhouse will transform into a 56,000+ square foot complex housing a 200-seat recital hall, administrative offices, a costume shop, a Ô¨Ålm studio, a rehearsal hall, and garden spaces. Theater Projects and A‚Äôkustiks, LLC., are developing the recital hall as a premiere venue to present classical singers and musicians, jazz ensembles, lectures and spoken word artists, and other performing arts.

11Alive News,"The Atlanta City Council has approved new ordinances that could significantly reshape the city's core by restricting where data centers can be developed. The legislation, which bars new data centers from being built near the BeltLine and within a half-mile of MARTA stations, is designed to prioritize human spaces over industrial use.

Atlanta's data center market has been one of the fastest-growing in the nation, driven by increased demand for digital infrastructure. However, city leaders are concerned that these developments could encroach on valuable urban space that is better used for public amenities.

The new restrictions will take effect once Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens signs them.

Tharon Johnson,"I believe the BeltLine is a public good, one which has already transformed our city for the better. Building the BeltLine has, at its core, built new communities and connections in our city, bringing us closer together in a way that I think even the most optimistic projections couldn‚Äôt have anticipated.

While division across the country has made big wins more rare, I believe the Atlanta BeltLine shines as a beacon of what is possible when we let our imaginations loose. The first step to rebuilding our divided communities is connecting them, a promise that the BeltLine is on track to fulfill.

11Alive News,"William Coleman was denied bond in court Monday. Coleman is accused of stabbing and killing an unhoused man Friday near the BeltLine, according to a spokesperson for the BeltLine. There is security footage of the alleged crime. 

A representative from the Georgia Department of Corrections told 11Alive that Coleman left the Atlanta Transitional Center, on Ponce de Leon Avenue, on June 22. and never returned. The center is not gated and sits near several business and housing units. 

In a statement Monday, GDOC said transitional centers assist offenders in returning to society in a structured setting.

Commissioner Natalie Hall of District 4, and The Beauty Industry kicked off the first episode of Women in Atlanta. It was a great conversation about uplifting and inspiring the community and how Women in Atlanta can be a part of the positive success. In this clip, Commissioner Hall discusses her Senior BeltLine Tour. Through her partnership with the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership, Fulton County seniors aged 55 and older are invited to a 3-hour tour of the 22-mile Atlanta BeltLine. This interactive, guided tour not only showcases the BeltLine‚Äôs contributions to our communities but also teaches seniors how they can actively participate in BeltLine activities.

The U.S. Department of Transportation will send more than $2.2 billion in grants to state, tribal and local governments under a grant program that was expanded under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law which our Congressman, Drew Ferguson, opposed.

I partnered with Atlanta City Councilman, Michael Julian Bond for the Hello Fresh Grab & Go event at the Helene Mills Senior Center. We were able to distribute hundreds of healthy meal kits to the residents of District 4. This is what I call true ‚ù§Ô∏è Work!

Atlanta Beltline, Inc. hosted its Q2 Business Breakfast. This quarter‚Äôs meeting was centered around building and maintaining business resiliency. I was honored to have the opportunity to speak alongside business owners Kristen Sumpter (Red‚Äôs Beer Garden), Pouya Dianat (CreateATL), and Kat Taylor (Bankhead Coffee). 

I had the privilege of attending and cheering on graduates at the Atlanta Technical College‚Äôs 2023 Commencement üéì I am so proud of our graduates and I look forward to seeing great things from them very soon!

I was a special guest at the 2nd Annual Morning of Hope Breakfast, hosted by St. Vincent de Paul. It was a powerful, one-of-a-kind experience where I was able to hear beautiful stories about the power of Hope ‚ú®

I had such an amazing evening at the Emory University President‚Äôs Reception. I want to thank President Fenves for dedicating an evening to recognize and honor the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and the Atlanta City Council.

Georgia Policy,"Some bad ideas never die. MARTA released details last fall on a plan to extend its streetcar 2.5 miles to Atlanta‚Äôs Beltline.

The first line of the Atlanta Streetcar system was implemented in 2015 and has been a terribly inefficient public transit program since its implementation. 

The numbers speak for themselves:

- The cost of the first 2.7 miles exceeded estimates at $99 million, or $36.7 million a mile, in 2015. In 2023, estimated costs ballooned to between $88 million to $107.5 million a mile for the proposed expansion with total project costs ranging from $176 million to $230 million.
- Even when it was free, ridership was significantly below capacity, and now that the line costs $1 a ride, ridership has sunk to an average of 400 riders a day in 2022. 
- The system has an average traveling speed of 5 mph. Considering the average human walking speed is 2.5 to 4 mph, it‚Äôs not unfair to say Atlanta‚Äôs streetcars are one of the slowest forms of public transportation available.

Rather than an expensive project that will serve a limited area and has limited demand by people living there, we should be looking at solutions that are a better fit for commuters of necessity, will actually reduce car usage within the city and be cost effective for taxpayers.

Fulton County Commissioner Natalie Hall-District 4,"I know how much my Seniors loved the BeltLine Tours and I really wanted to work towards bringing them back. We haven't had the chance to do any since the pandemic and I'm so happy we were able to make it happen this year! 

I partnered with Atlanta BeltLine Partnership to bring Seniors a 3-hour tour of the Atlanta BeltLine Westside Trail. The event gave Fulton County Seniors an opportunity to see everything the Westside Trail has to offer. This fun, interactive, guided tour also taught Seniors how they can engage in BeltLine activities. 

Thank you to Michael Davis Atlanta BeltLine Partnership & Pittsburgh Yards for assisting with our 1st tour since 2019!

Bibb County GOP,"Warnock Steered $16 Million to Project That Benefited Co-Owner of Church‚Äôs Controversial Apartment Complex‚ÄîToday, Team Herschel released the following statement highlighting an article from The Washington Free Beacon titled: ""Warnock Steered $16 Million to Project That Benefited Co-Owner of Church‚Äôs Controversial Apartment Complex.‚Äù Georgia Democratic senator Raphael Warnock steered $16.4 million in federal earmarks to a project that benefited the co-owner of his controversial low-income apartment complex. ""The funding was intended to construct a trail connecting a residential and commercial complex known as ""Pittsburgh Yards"" with other portions of Atlanta's BeltLine. The developer of Pittsburgh Yards is Columbia Ventures, part of the Columbia group of companies that co-owns and operates a low-income housing complex with Warnock's church. ""The funding raises questions about whether Warnock's business relationship with Columbia had any bearing on his funding decision. Warnock did not respond to a request for comment. ""Warnock's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he serves as senior pastor and CEO, in 2005 'formed a partnership with Columbia Residential to rehabilitate [a] dilapidated high-rise' and turned the building into low-income apartments. Ebenezer and Columbia are co-owners of the business through a joint venture, with Ebenezer owning 99 percent and Columbia owning the remaining 1 percent, according to a state grant application filed by the entities in August. ""Last November, Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.) announced that they had helped secure the funding for the trail project, which would 'construct approximately two miles of the Southside Trail component of the Atlanta BeltLine from Pittsburgh Yards to Boulevard Crossing Park.'"" ""Raphael Warnock is a corrupt hypocrite who only cares about himself, not the people of Georgia,"" said campaign spokesman Will Kiley. ""Warnock lines his pockets and the pockets of his allies while attempting to evict low-income tenants in the building he oversees. Since coming to office, Warnock has doubled his income while Georgia families struggle to make ends meet. Raphael Warnock needs to be held accountable by the 'media' and the people of Georgia for his lies.""",2022-11-22T20:12:38.000Z,4.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,True

---Twenty-three years ago, Atlanta-native and architecture and urban planning student Ryan Gravel had an experience that opened his mind to what urban living could be.
""My senior year I spent abroad in Paris and lived without a car for a year and traveled by train everywhere,"" says Gravel. ""And within a month of arriving, I had lost 15 pounds. I was in the best shape of my life because I was walking everywhere, and the role of the physical city was made clear to me in a way it really had never been before.""
For his Georgia Tech master's thesis, Gravel sketched out a plan to make Atlanta more like Paris. He proposed redeveloping the land along the city's historic rail lines to create a 22-mile loop called the Atlanta BeltLine. He proposed turning the city's abandoned industrial areas and single-family home neighborhoods into business districts and walking trails. And he proposed connecting downtown to the rest of the city all with a new train running along the entire Atlanta BeltLine.
""I never imagined we would actually do it,"" says Gravel.
But they did‚Äîfor the most part. Cathy Woolard, who was president of the Atlanta City Council, read Gravel's thesis and decided to use it as a blueprint to remake much of the city. Today, the Atlanta BeltLine is a walking and biking trail, parts of which are bordered by retail and condos.
But one piece of Gravel's grand vision didn't get built: The train.
Today, Gravel runs a co-working and event space along the BeltLine, which also serves as a gathering place for urbanists interested in making Atlanta less dependent on cars. He says that the train line is essential for improving city life.
""In those early days, when we built the movement behind the [BeltLine] project, it was around transit,"" says Gravel.
The three COVID relief bills set aside $69 billion in federal funding for local transit agencies to operate and add to their transportation systems, meaning that Atlanta might finally get its train‚Äîwith many American taxpayers who will never step foot on it picking up much of the tab.
Many American cities have used federal money in the past to build rail transit lines that suffer from dismal ridership, that are expensive to maintain, and that are a major drain on their budgets.

Atlanta (/√¶tÀàl√¶nt…ô/) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Georgia. With an estimated 2019 population of 506,811,[10] it is also the 37th most populous city in the United States. The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area, home to more than six million people and the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the nation.[8] Atlanta is the seat of Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia. Portions of the city extend eastward into neighboring DeKalb County. The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River.[13]
Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad. With rapid expansion, however, it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The city's name derives from that of the Western and Atlantic Railroad's local depot, signifying the town's growing reputation as a transportation hub.[14] During the American Civil War, the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. However, the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the ""New South"". During the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership.[15] During the modern era, Atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub, with Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport being the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998.[16][17][18][19]
It ranks in the top twenty among world cities and 10th in the nation with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $385 billion.[20][21] Atlanta's economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors that include aerospace, transportation, logistics, professional and business services, media operations, medical services, and information technology.[22] Atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and dense tree coverage, earning it the nickname of ""the city in a forest"".[23] Gentrification of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline, altering the city's demographics, politics, aesthetic, and culture.[24][25][26]

During the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership.[15] During the modern era, Atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub, with Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport being the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998.[16][17][18][19]
It ranks in the top twenty among world cities and 10th in the nation with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $385 billion.[20][21] Atlanta's economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors that include aerospace, transportation, logistics, professional and business services, media operations, medical services, and information technology.[22] Atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and dense tree coverage, earning it the nickname of ""the city in a forest"".[23] Gentrification of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline, altering the city's demographics, politics, aesthetic, and culture.[24][25][26]#Atlanta #AtlantaGeorgia #AtlantaSkyline #AtlantaCity #AtlantaDrone #AtlantaatNight

Dr. Fahamu P√©cou,"We Can‚Äôt Cop Cars Without Seeing Cop Cars‚Äù is a site specific installation by artist/scholar Dr. Fahamu Pecou. The installation features a short film by the same title displayed within a modified Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor.
Crown Victoria Interceptors are a popular vehicle used in police forces across the country. When decommissioned, they are repurposed and sold at auto auctions, often purchased by Black men in urban communities. The irony of the Crown Victoria being a popular car amongst Black men can‚Äôt be overstated, but the silhouette of the vehicle continues to have a visceral affect.

The project explores the notion of Black leisure by highlighting spaces where Black men can experience freedom, autonomy, and joy. Few representations of Black life depict these images or even considers these as valid experiences. We Can‚Äôt Cop‚Ä¶ uses cars as an allegorical as well as a literal suggestion of movement and escapism from the stresses and traumas of the world. From fear, to triumph, to joy and back to reality, the short film uses the aesthetics of magical realism to give viewers a momentary glimpse into the complex emotional landscape of Black male masculinity.‚Äù Written and Directed by Fahamu Pecou
