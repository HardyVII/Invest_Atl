City representatives saw in Colorado-based organization Babe Walls the fulfillment of their ambitions for the 2-mile-long mini version of the Atlanta Beltline.

‚ÄúWe had so many community members say that they didn‚Äôt know the space was down there,‚Äù said Chamblee Public Arts Coordinator Teneisha Jones. ‚ÄúSo hopefully we will see an increase in usage as well. We are so happy with the results of the mural festival, and working with Babe Walls was a smooth process.‚Äù

Atlanta Beltline Marketplace partnered with Atlanta Indie Market to feature over 30 small businesses across three different locations on the Beltline this past Saturday.

Small business owners say local markets such as these are essential to their business, especially as the economy has made it more difficult to afford supplies and ingredients, and as such, turn a profit.

Atlanta Indie Market sets up on the Beltline every second Saturday of the month with local vendors, games, buskers and music.

The Beltline acquired 425 Chappell Rd. three years ago for nearly $26 million from developer Brock Built Homes. The Beltline envisions up to 1,100 residences on the site, with nearly a third reserved as affordable housing, alongside 5,000 square feet of commercial space.

The organization filed paperwork last week outlining a $270 million plan to develop the land. The Beltline estimates the entire development could be finished by 2030.

The more Santiago ponders his next move, the more a concept called @poncecitymarket sounds appealing‚Äîlargely because it would be connected to @atlantabeltline‚Äôs brand-new Eastside Trail. ‚ÄúThe Beltline brought that kind of cosmopolitan, walking-around feel of a city,‚Äù recalls Santiago. ‚ÄúIt really changed the city to me. And I wanted to be in the center of it.‚Äù As for Santiago, his Ponce City bet paid off. @elsuperpan_pcm, his Latin bar for sandwiches and cocktails, has become a cornerstone (literally, on a can‚Äôt-miss corner) of the food hall, and joins original tenants such as @bellinaalimentari, @mineroatl, Jia, and W.H. Stiles Fish Camp, which are still feeding roughly 10,000 daily visitors. Santiago has claimed another corner space for a second concept, tapas bar @lametroatl and he estimates his original fast-casual business tallies 300 orders per day on average. ‚ÄúWe have the traffic of being at the airport,‚Äù Santiago says. ‚ÄúAnd every year it grows‚Äîwell, apart from the pandemic.‚Äù‚Å†

On Thursday, Mayor Andre Dickens and Atlanta Beltline Inc. President and CEO Clyde Higgs announced the acquisition of the Elleven45 Lounge at 2110 Peachtree Road NW. The Beltline acquired the roughly one-acre site for $11 million.

The controversial nightclub was the scene of a fatal shooting in the early morning hours of May 12. Two people were killed and two wounded. One arrest was made in the shooting. The city of Atlanta shut the nightclub down months later after a Fulton Superior Court judge ruled the venue a public nuisance. 

The nightclub property was needed to complete Segment 2 of the Northwest Trail located near Piedmont Atlanta Hospital, the largest employer in the Beltline Planning Area.

This segment is a 0.7-mile stretch being built outside the railroad corridor starting at the southwest corner of Bobby Jones Golf Course, running east along Colonial Homes Circle, and then passing under Peachtree Road. A construction date for Segment 2 is not yet known.

It could just be me but I'm gonna share something I'm gonna tell you guys one thing. I was on my way home yesterday or actually two days ago and a gentleman I guess had an accident. He ran into somebody on the motorcycle and the traffic was like stand still. It blocked actually the direction I had to go to my place and everybody was so impatient just mad like you know. But you can tell the wreck was like so bad to the point where like it literally had I had to like redirect and like just park. I just poured over and I went into the parking lot and I'm just sharing it so we can get a perspective of how life is guys. I was short and a flash of a blink of eye it could be over. And I pull over and I'm just watching I'm looking from where I was parked at to just observe what was going on because they had everything taped off. And I saw this car just total and I'm like yo so you know inside of me I'm like I'm trying to get home. I was coming from the thing I was coming from working out of somewhere and I was like you know had that impatient energy on me. But something in my spare was like just pull over pull over so when I pulled over and I looked I pulled over and I looked in observed that I saw a gentleman standing there like I thought he was observing it too. I thought we were both like kind of just being those he was checking and checking it out. But my concern was I was just like yo whoever was in that car and I know God Jesus name I hope they're okay because I really was observing the accident. Next thing I know I finally like see the gentleman who's next to me saying I said today make it and the guy he didn't say anything with the lady next term was like it was him. I was like yo I'm like buddy yeah you know I'm looking at him it was a young man he was a lot younger than myself. He had to be in his like early 20s even if he was there yet and he looked disorientated you know and I kind of just was like I said so what's the other person you know I'm saying his car total. And they said the other guy was in a motorcycle like and I'm like whoa because his car was like that so they said the guy wasn't moving or anything they were trying to prop him up I guess. So people who were standing there started coming around me they said that buddy who was on the bike property is dead this was an um Rupa like calendar area I was calm it's close this indicator area and Atlanta so I know they had them in the news or whatnot excuse me. So and when I spoke to the gentleman I was like yo so the guy on the bike we probably already know he was going. And I'm sharing this because people a lot of times we get the going like hearing there we're not appreciating the now like we really have to and I don't want to be cliche but this is facts because even as I'm driving now I get up this morning and like I don't know the weather is kind of gloomy. Um overcatch why am and this energy I'm feeling in the atmosphere is kind of like it's very training it's like I don't know if it's just me late like I'm going to be in the middle of the night. It's like I don't know if it's just me late. I've been feeling this training energy like it's trying to set everything that's going on in our in our lives right now and we have to be mindful guys that we have to encourage and keep inspiring ourselves because it's within side of us you know what I mean like people are not caring anymore you know about anybody's like everybody's so self centered on trying to get the bag just survive we have to realize even that's a setup guys we have to stop worrying about the bag because it's not the bag it's us actually looking out for one another guys we have it all backwards we think we have to just go to work and we see that hasn't been working obviously because it seems like it doesn't matter how hard you work to get the bag I don't care what you are seeing on social media for um for the life part but for the majority the majority of people are not living this lavish life that's projected. To make others feel like downcast and you're not downcast we're not now. I'm not here too grinding to survive because it's about survival right now but I'm gonna tell us something we have to care and I'm telling me too because when I spoke to the gentleman the young man that was uh had just had the accident and I saw how this orientated he was it was amazing when I and I'm glad I poured up because when I spoke to him I could sense that I was in the middle of the world. It's just that he needed just someone to step p that it wasn't about giving out no money about nothing just the show support I got I don't even know you but I care for you. I love you and I don't know you homie but I can for your life because what's going on today is almost as if people don't even care about life itself or anybody and I'm going to tell you something. That's the test like if we just get caught up in ourselves about things survival mode making it to get the bag I understand that guys but it is our duty as a human being to give a to give a crap about one another it is you know we're not put on this earth all you'll be on this earth by yourself because I'ma tell you something my spirit was showing me it was happy that I did it I'm going to not going to like I wasn't trying to get again home myself at the time but after I did it I felt the sense of relief not like I'm proud of myself but I felt the relief from what even when my mind said was up until that moment of me giving out that energy because it's about energy guys frequency and it comes from the heart you can't make it up and it's like even though I poured it to him it was almost like he poured it to me it was weird something came back and touched me that I didn't understand but I felt it and I'ma tell you something money can't buy that guys so it showed me what we're going to this new dimension and what the universe is doing is cleaning up all of this false narrative matrix since the pride and be selfish ambition and self-centeredness of the heart and as like not being so anxious but taking a moment to appreciate the now not only with ourselves but with everything around us everybody everything stop being so on a hurry guys that we don't appreciate because that's where we're messing up while we're chasing the bad we need to chase love in each other in the sense of caring just the point of caring so I just want to say to everybody I love you guys whenever you got going on remember this you're not the only one and somebody loves you somebody does love you nobody told you they love you I love you love yourself because it's not easy to it especially if you walk in and this walk where you're in and all of us are in it because we have to survive but let's not forget guys that us being here is is is a pursuit of learning and understanding and evolving and spirit not just some physical and the more we go within ourselves to care and appreciate the right now and everything stop doubting stop looking around and judging and appreciating whatever it is and building and learn from it everything that I've been dealing with and going through I'm looking at it from a very different perspective now while realize now it's not meant to destroy you because it's meant to you suppose to learn we're so used to just feeling like what we gain in assets or whatever it is is a win and let me tell you something every game in assets is not a win as we a lot of us has learned and time you be on this earth long enough you're like sometimes the losses were the best gains we ever had from understanding and learning so and all guys today if you're hearing this appreciate the now love yourself tell yourself you love yourself three times look in a mirror appreciate yourself that way you can appreciate everything and everyone around you I love you God bless you have a wonderful day and help somebody appreciate everybody God bless you,no longer populated,,2024-11-03T14:45:31.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSW9iQkMwPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--20cf5213307b076c8b53dc5afd42208055562be2/post-28616129-363146048-thumbnail,2,0,0,19,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTGtqQkMwPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1d819864dc899cca2e424b6c69ccf3a54f6c74a1/o8skqIHEB8lW8AjzAifPAVQDCioA8ziCH2AIUn,

Located in Peachtree Battle on Woodward Way along the Atlanta Beltline, the facility is expected to cost $45 million with core funding already secured, according to a press release from the Opera. Announcements of the donors and a capital campaign will be announced soon, and the project is estimated to be completed by the summer of 2027.

The long-vacant clubhouse, which served the Bobby Jones Golf Course in Atlanta Memorial Park, was built in the Grecian revival built in the early 1900s.

The 17,000 square foot clubhouse will transform into a 56,000+ square foot complex housing a 200-seat recital hall, administrative offices, a costume shop, a Ô¨Ålm studio, a rehearsal hall, and garden spaces. Theater Projects and A‚Äôkustiks, LLC., are developing the recital hall as a premiere venue to present classical singers and musicians, jazz ensembles, lectures and spoken word artists, and other performing arts.

With the spread of the interstate highway system in the 1960s and 70s, many of the railway lines on which Atlanta was built soon became abandoned. From 1994, a young Georgia Tech student by the name of Ryan Gravel was studying abroad in Paris, living just a block from an abandoned railway viaduct near the banks of the river Sen. Five years later, now as a Georgia Tech graduate student studying architecture and city planning, Gravel returned to Paris and saw how the former railway relic had been transformed into a half mile elevated walking garden, with arts related businesses and studios below. Gravel saw how the project revitalized the surrounding neighbourhoods and wrote his master's thesis on how the same could be done with Atlanta's abandoned belt line, which was built in the decades following the Civil War to alleviate rail congestion downtown.

The legislation, which bars new data centers from being built near the BeltLine and within a half-mile of MARTA stations, is designed to prioritize human spaces over industrial use.

Atlanta's data center market has been one of the fastest-growing in the nation, driven by increased demand for digital infrastructure. However, city leaders are concerned that these developments could encroach on valuable urban space that is better used for public amenities.

The new restrictions will take effect once Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens signs them.

Some motorists turning right onto Memorial Drive from Boulevard are driving into the new lanes meant for cyclists. Concerned residents have shared pictures with Atlanta News First showing cars in the wrong lane.

Cyclists like Ian Wells told Atlanta News First that signage for the lanes would be helpful.

‚ÄúSigns on Memorial and Boulevard that you‚Äôre coming up to a bike corridor,‚Äù Wells said. ‚ÄúLike, the Beltline has a lot of signage.‚Äù

#atlantanews #atlantanewsfirst #georgia","all right good morning everybody thanks so much for being with us here on Atlanta news first Plus for our segment called in case you missed it I'm Joy knan here with Brooks Baptist hey good morning to you Joy so we've got a couple of stories that we're watching right now and one of which being something I think we all can relate to trying to get ourselves out of a membership or a subscription service we know that struggle can be well the Biden Administration is doing something right now where it is hoping to make that a bit easier for all of you who have had to run into that issue so this proposed package of rules is dubbed time is money so it's aiming to remove excessive paperwork and call hold times for customers cancelling subscriptions also we know how important that is when you're trying to submit a health claim and also trying to get in touch with human customer service Representatives because how many times have you said speak to a representative speak to a represent you're just yelling at the phone and the phone does not care well this part of the White House has cracked down on so-called junk fees through recently other Biden Administration or I should say though recently other Biden Administration proposals have been temporarily blocked by federal courts so joy we have to wait and see what happens here but come on now we've all had to deal with this and it's been a struggle I know and then it's just like I I already plann that you know when you're on hold for that sort of thing I already planned like okay this is when I'm going to do my laundry I'm going to do this you know what that's what I'm going to make that call when I'm doing something else because you know you're going to have a lot of time that you're stuck on hold that's how it goes exact also this do you remember the days of taking the SAT and the ACT oh yes I do I took the AC sat not the ACT see I did both and I always thought the Act was slightly easier but all right well now they're making some changes so here's kind of a heads up SL reminder for you if you do have a child that is getting ready to try and get in college and whatnot so the college admissions test is evolving with the goal to give students more flexibility when it comes to test taking so those changes include making the test a bit shorter because if you've been in there you know how long those tests can be and also they want to make the science section optional experts say students will be encouraged to take the science section especially if they're working toward a scholarship the test actually as far as the concepts that are going to be tested on it has not changed significantly at all what has changed is you know what sounds wonderful which is that science is going to be optional honestly I'm not changing my prep very much all right so those changes will not apply to this year's College hopefuls uh but those changes will roll out in Spring of 2025 I don't know you know I always go back and forth about this because I'm all for um you know test taking and whatnot although I couldn't stand it when I had to do it but we all have to go through it right I don't know if if I don't need the science score and that's going to impact My overall score why would I need to take it if I don't if I have the option that that is a good question I mean I feel like if you if you don't have to take most take it most people will not take it and is that really a good thing do we want kids to kind of be in a position where they're forced to learn a little bit about science I mean well I don't know Joy because I'm still trying to put to use some of that science that I learned in college that I didn't sign up for but part of the gened courses and I still have not found um in this profession a day where I've had to use that so I I don't know I I get it because you know we had this conversation in the studio as well earlier this morning and first radiologist elor brought up the point she was like well I needed science and I love science but I don't need writing necessarily and then I said well actually we all have to know how to read to comprehend we all have to know how to write even if it's just to write an email to your boss or to a colleague we kind of have to be able to do that so I can see both ways but I also just think as a kid you don't know what you're going to be when you grow up that's right now that's a great point and then and sometimes you know and that's your opportunity to kind of learn even what you like and what when I was younger I thought I was going to be a doctor until I in college I flun chemistry and biology I mean I didn't flung but it was it almost almost I they kept me they didn't kick me out but look you became a lawyer and a legal expert so I'm just saying you still did good things my friend well thank you so much not that we ended up here so I get to work with Brooks bapti maybe that's something all right all right well thank you so much Brook so appreciate it all right speaking of confusion there is a lot of confusion about bike Lanes right now um and yeah I mean people are are are not happy about this situation so um th this I apologize I'm trying to change a graphic and I'm multitasking I'm going to find you that graphic but most importantly the story here is that there's a lot of confus about these new bike Lanes both driver cyclists concerned that a lack of signs is going to lead to accidents state representative Devon Seau is now accused of running into a a cyclist near Memorial Drive in Boulevard in Southeast Atlanta Atlanta news first yasmina Alon is near the area to explain what is going on the confusion starts at the intersection behind me of Memorial Drive and Boulevard where some drivers are making that right turn onto Boulevard and ending up in the bike lanes you've probably noticed the curb stops creating another Lane on Memorial Drive that lane is meant for cyclists though that message hasn't quite gotten across to everyone cyclist Ian Wells rides his bike on this road often he says he is thankful for the addition of the designated bike Lanes but thinks signs alerting drivers as they turn from Boulevard would be helpful signs on Memorial Boulevard that you're coming up to a bike Corridor like they do with the belt line has a lot of signage on concerned drivers in res residents have shared pictures showing cars driving in the bike Lanes after accidentally making that turn into them this picture shows several cars in the wrong lane face Toof face with a cyclist also in the lane so the bike lane is still under construction and it is for people biking and scooting any kind of small wheels not for cars not for trucks Rebecca Cerna is the executive director for Propel ATL a group that advocated for the lanes because it is a high Crush Corridor she says she understands the frustrations but reminds people the project is still not done because it's still under construction it doesn't have the posts at the end that will prevent drivers from driving into it mistakenly and it doesn't yet have the green paint and the bike lane symbols that will clearly tell everyone what the space is meant for this is the same area where Georgia state representative Devon seot turned into the bike lanane and is accused of hitting a cyclist on Thursday night police say he was driving Under the Influence at the time in a social media post over the weekend the representative pointed out there was no proper signage for the bike lane we'd like to see the um construction time be compressed as much as possible because there is the potential for confusion and the Georgia Department of Transportation said they urge cyclists to avoid using those Lanes until a project is complete they're also reminding drivers to pay attention they expect this project to be completed by the end of October in Southeast Atlanta yes Mina Alon Atlanta news first and thanks so much to Yas mea for that report we'll keep following the latest there okay let's talk about um some summer meal funding so Georgia parents and some State leaders are asking the governor to approve Federal funding for summer meals now Georgia is one of 13 states that opted out this year but there is still a chance for next summer Atlanta news first reporter Abby curus explains okay I need you to be quiet for me please Tasha Miller is a parent to three kids her school age daughter is one of 1.2 million Georgia students to receive free School breakfast and lunch without those meals during the summertime she says she's been asking for help we're utilizing a food pantry right now and we are able to go once a week I know a lot of food pantries don't have that option sunbucks is a federal program offering students who already qualify for free or reduced lunch during the school year $120 per summer Miller says it means she could afford to buy more meat and produce for her family she signed a petition with more than 3,000 other par calling on Governors in hold out states to approve the funding Democrat leaders writing to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to urge him to do the same these Federal resources to help families feed their kids are available for the state of Georgia and what I'd urge is that the governor accept these Federal resources to help families across Georgia afford food in the summertime in July Kemp's office sent us this statement defending his itic ISM of the program citing concerns over the lack of nutritional requirements and a lack of fiscal sustainability and all we're asking is that you put our kids and our families first Abby curus Atlanta news first thanks so much to Abby for that

This project embodies WFF's vision: restoring the historic Westside to a community Dr. King would be proud to call home. With deeply affordable units - 20% at 30% AMI, 30% at 60% AMI, 50% at 80% AMI - near the Westside Beltline Connector Trail, we're creating opportunities for inclusive growth.

Thank you to Mayor @andreforatlanta and Councilman @byronamos for joining us and delivering thoughtful remarks, and for your continued leadership and steadfast support. 

Thanks is also due to our grant funders have made it possible for us to offer permanent affordability through this new development:

Right. Oh, some big things coming to the A, that&#39;s exciting Chesley. That&#39;s absolutely right. I can&#39;t wait to see it. Can&#39;t wait to see it. Take a look. We have, uh, a few showers out there right now. This is mainly up here to the far north. Notice that one little lightning strike just over into northern parts of Banks County starting to pop up right there. That&#39;s it. That will be moving out of the state momentarily gets out of the way and we&#39;ll be left with the clouds in place. Anywhere from partly to, uh, mostly cloudy skies will be the call for much of the day today. Temperature wise. We&#39;re in the seventies, folks starting off right at 76 degrees in Atlanta. That is your warm spot. 75 close in Gainesville, 72. Over toward Georgia&#39;s Rome, 75 in Marietta, 72. Down toward the Grange, 73 degrees in Thomaston. You got some sixties up here to the far north 69 degrees Blairsville and over toward Clayton at the current tower, uh, throughout the southeast is we&#39;re expecting to see those showers. You can see some of them starting the dwindle just a little bit there. We have some in Arkansas over toward Mississippi and Louisiana. Even into Alabama, those are starting to weaken a little bit as more move into the northern portions of the state right there. Um We&#39;ll see more popping up a little bit later on this afternoon, watching every little pressure up to the north is sliding along that stationary boundary. So that will continue to slide further off to the north. High pressure down here to the south continuing to rotate in all that moisture into the area. So it just stays over us. We&#39;re in the soup folks. So that pattern will continue as we head through the week. In fact, our chance of rain starts to amp up just a little bit here is our map that shows where that moisture is, where you got the oranges and the yellows in there, that deep moisture, uh the darker, the colors, the deeper the moisture. So you have it up and down the eastern seaboard for today. Those brighter colors up there, even that blue indicates a little bit of drier air. And I wanna show you this because that&#39;s what&#39;s coming out now through the rest of the week, we&#39;ll be dealing with the moisture we&#39;re socked in here. We notice it up to here by Thursday. I think that&#39;ll be our highest threat for the rain to be around. Notice how that blues tries to start to sink down just a little bit as we head into the weekend, still enough moisture that we&#39;ll see some scattered showers, thunderstorms around our area even through the weekend. But as we head into next week, that&#39;s when some of that dry air tries to filter back down into the area. As you can see, at least by Tuesday we&#39;re starting to see some blues popping up. So just wanna show you far out maybe a change in the pattern as we head into next week. Until then we&#39;re stuck here. We are 40% chance for this afternoon. Looking at a 50% chance for the rain on Wednesday by Thursday, 60% chance. So we&#39;re amping up as we head through the weekend, we&#39;ll be going back down, down to a 40% chance as we head into Saturday. So here&#39;s how it all plays out for us. Forecast track model shows again, the clouds around this morning shower could break out at any time and you saw just a few of those up to our far north and east. Uh We&#39;ll see a little better chance for that rain. Once we get past 23 o&#39;clock, now there could be some very heavy downpours and some spots. So be on the lookout for that again, the heavy downpours could lead to some flash flooding in a few spots. We&#39;ll do it all over again as we head into Wednesday, starting off Wednesday morning, anywhere from partly to mostly cloudy skies. Once we get to the afternoon, mostly cloudy skies and then the chance for those scud of showers and thunderstorms popping up in the area. If you don&#39;t receive any rain today, tomorrow could be your day. And then certainly by Thursday we&#39;ll do it all over again, partly to mostly cloudy skies or in the afternoons when those Scottish showers and thunderstorms break out into the area. And again, I think it sticks around for the rest of the work week. We&#39;re looking at 88 for the high today, I think will be the warmest of the week. 87 tomorrow. 82 Thursday, we get an 84 degrees on Friday and as we head into the weekend, temperatures will stay in the mid eighties, 86 both Saturday and Sunday with a 40% chance for scat of showers during the afternoon, 30% chance by the time we get to Monday with 86. So hopefully some dry air will start to work in from there. And by Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, we&#39;ll have a bigger smile on our faces. Hopefully, we got a smile.

Building the BeltLine has, at its core, built new communities and connections in our city, bringing us closer together in a way that I think even the most optimistic projections couldn‚Äôt have anticipated.

While division across the country has made big wins more rare, I believe the Atlanta BeltLine shines as a beacon of what is possible when we let our imaginations loose. The first step to rebuilding our divided communities is connecting them, a promise that the BeltLine is on track to fulfill.

We know the Belt line very busy place with a lot of people scary situation here. What do we know today about Coleman? Authorities say that he, that Coleman was in a work program at the facility when he left his or did not return rather from his assignment. We recently within the last hour heard from the Georgia Department of Corrections. He is the third person that we have reported has left that facility just this year in court today. William Coleman&#39;s attorney said he was a long time Atlanta resident, but a judge still denied the 27 year old Bond. Coleman is accused of stabbing a man on the belt line Friday at the time. Authorities say he was a resident of the Atlanta Transitional Housing Center. He went missing on the 22nd of June and a bolo was sent on the 26. If they have lunch, they can go outside and sit down in the right frame of mind. It&#39;s very easy to walk away. Susan Burns with the and civil rights coalition explains. The Georgia Department of Corrections should do more to inform the public Department of Corrections should issue a press release as soon as they know someone is gone. A statement from GD said in part, unfortunately, some individuals make a decision not to return to the facility from their jobs or otherwise leave the facility when that occurs. The GDC dedicates all of our fugitive unit resources toward immediate action and recapture. We&#39;re continuing to work to try and learn more about what happened between the time Coleman left for his assignment and did not return. And when an initial bolo was said that he was not at the facility, we&#39;ve also been reaching out to the coroner or the medical examiner all day. We have still not learned the identity of the person who was stabbed back to you. All right. Thank you so much.

And now we&#39;re learning residents in that neighborhood were never told the escaped inmate was possibly in their midst. 11. Has Teresa bows has there concerns tonight, Teresa Ron, that center is two blocks away from places like Mary Max tea room and mere steps away from several housing units. And some neighbors fear that the deadly stabbing, stabbing at the belt line could have easily been them. Instead, some residents in this midtown neighborhood, I live alone. I walk my dog at night, aren&#39;t aware who their neighbors are. And as Emma Nare found out, I didn&#39;t even know that that existed so close to my home. She lives just around the corner from an ung transitional home for over 250 inmates which wouldn&#39;t have been a big deal to Nair had it not been for a deadly Friday when one of those inmates got out, they can go outside and sit down and the right frame of mind, it&#39;s very easy to walk away. According to the Department of Corrections website, the Atlanta Transitional Center is a minimum security housing facility for male inmates nearing the end of incarceration. Atlanta police arrested escapee William Coleman for stabbing and killing who was described as an unhoused man near the beltline burns says she didn&#39;t even hear about it. Please inform the neighbors about what&#39;s going on. Don&#39;t leave us in the dark. Susan Burns is the deputy director of the Human and Civil Rights Coalition of Georgia. A spokesperson for the DOC said quote be on the lookouts were issued by the G dc&#39;s fugitive task force to the Gwinnett County sheriff&#39;s office and Atlanta Police Department on June 26 which means Coleman has been missing for more than a week. Burns says it&#39;s not enough communication department of Correction should issue a press release as soon as they know someone is gone. Burns says inmates escape more often than we think Charles Smith escaped from this same facility last year. Then Melvin Barkley five months ago, burns says state leaders have to step up security before someone else gets hurt. This is a public safety issue. And again, it&#39;s the largest public safety department in the state of Georgia. Where is the responsibility though? The murder is still under investigation? Burns says Coleman could face five years for escaping along with whatever else the judge decides for his alleged crimes. He was set to be released in October 2025.

We have the details of the First Alert Weather Day along with the forecast for the week ahead. Plus, a check of the morning's top news stories including what we're learning about a suspect arrested in a deadly stabbing on the Atlanta BeltLine.",good morning it is Sunday thanks for checking in with us here at Atlanta news first plus here's what it looks like in Midtown right now look at these cloudy conditions and you feel it the minute you walk out the door it is muggy another hot one out there today so hope you have been staying cool and enjoying your long holiday weekend if it was a long one for you good morning I'm Megan Packer and again thanks for checking in here at Atlanta news first plus it is Sunday morning might be a long weekend but we have been working all weekend long keeping you updated on the top news stories and your forecast so we'll check in with First Alert meteorologist Courtney jackaboi in just a moment to help you plan your Sunday and get ready to go back to work tomorrow for the week but right now I'll get you caught up on what's making news this morning and we have been following this big story from the Atlanta belt line all weekend long we were talking about the deadly stabbing that happened on the Belt Line Friday night and here's a look at the man now facing charges for it 27-year-old William Coleman is in jail charged with a few offenses including murder that stabbing happened Friday night police say Coleman was already wanted for escaping he was most recently held at the Atlanta Transitional center which works with inmates near the end of their sentences now the victim who was killed has not yet been identif ified we are working to learn more from police about that and they have not shared details about what exactly led up to that deadly encounter Beltline officials initially said yesterday that the incident involved two people who were homeless so still a lot of questions about this but you can imagine there is relief from people who live in that neighborhood who walk and run on that part of the Belt Line knowing there was an arrest but still really unnerving for people that are out there just knowing that something like that happened it wasn't too late in the night on Friday when it happened happened and so it just had a lot of people on edge but uh they are relieved to know that there has at least been an arrest in that case a teenager who drowned while swimming on taibe island this weekend is from Atlanta 16-year-old laquis McCrae was on vacation with his girlfriend's family he and two others were in the water at Back River Beach when the waves swept over them were told that two others including his girlfriend were rescued but McCrae did not resurface he was a rising senior at Booker T Washington High School in Atlanta we had a chance to talk with his mother yesterday she says this was the first time that he was even at the beach and now she is urging everybody to be safe around the water this summer if you are unfamiliar with it or uncomfortable she just urges you to only go in a little bit just up to your ankles don't push it and don't feel pressured to go swimming she says the family is now raising money to bring his body home and money for his funeral as the 4th of July uh travel period and long weekend wraps up a lot of people are going to be flying and driving today and just a heads up to take it easy on the roads we have been keeping an eye on the numbers uh I believe it's up to 15 now uh as far as the number of fatalities of people who have died on Georgia roads so far over the Fourth of July travel period And if you're headed to Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport today and tomorrow are expected to be the busiest days for return flights we had our crew out there this morning they were keeping an ey on the security lines they were moving but it was already pretty crowded as you would imagine on this last day before folks come back after their getaway a cob County family is looking for answers as They Mourn the death of their loved one he was a cyclist who was hit and killed by a driver who took off 57-year-old Ryan Ellis was riding his bike on Cob Parkway last month when he was hit from behind now his family is urging that driver to turn thems in the father and grandfather is described by his loved ones as loving funny and a family man police did find the car that hit Alice but there was no sign of the driver an NFL player who was from Metro Atlanta was back in town hosting a youth football camp in this Heat Miami Dolphins linebacker Bradley chub held his chub Foundation youth football camp at Midtown high school yesterday he says each year he holds an event in Atlanta and in whatever City where he's currently playing the goal is to show kids their future is in their hands so we know that these future football players loved it and they got to hang out with him got to run some drills we see here very very cool how fun would that be to learn from the pro like that what an unforgettable experience it's just um very hot out there for Camp like that or any Camp the kids are attending this weekend you really do have to take it easy and it's muggy already right now let's take another look outside over midtown Atlanta and just very cloudy these clouds have been hanging around for a while First Alert meteorologist Jack abazi is here now and Courtney we're also getting ready for the storms again today exactly today not going to be the prettiest end to the long weekend for a lot of you I know everyone kind of wrapping up their uh Fourth of July holiday and we do have our first alert weather day today because it is going to be another stormy afternoon today just something to get you ready for very very similar to yesterday forecast wise so uh we'll have quite a bit to talk about but right now yeah dreary start to the day cloudy muggy kind of soupy out there not a very comfortable start but all that moisture in the air is ultimately going to promote a pretty stormy afternoon which is the reason for our first alert weather day today and tomorrow so let's talk about all of it to get you ready for it again today and tomorrow widely scattered thunderstorms mainly for the afternoon and evening those are the reasons for our first alert weather days today and for your Monday now we definitely need the rain though uh these scattered storms probably welcome to a lot of your yards the month of June we picked up 1.74 in of of rain and only in the first handful of days of July we've already picked up just under an inch and a half of rain so what we picked up the entire month of June we've already almost received in just the first few days of July definitely making up for some loss time there with that Surplus uh just over 4/10 of an inch for the month which is going to hopefully help put a dent in our deficit and help uh improve our drought conditions that we started to get into uh last month if you are planning on heading to the pool today I'm sure a lot of you spent some time by the water this weekend uh today won't be necessarily a terrible day to do it I do think we'll see a little more Sunshine as we head past lunchtime uh but we will also introduce the chance for scattered showers and thunderstorms especially for those of you who live north of I 85 up in the mountains over near Lake laner definitely think you have the better coverage of rain today you'll also see the rain and storms first and then for those of you who live east of I75 it looks like we'll have rain and storms set up there as we head into the afternoon but becoming more widely scattered mainly after 4 5:00 so just if you have any plans to go to the pool today be anywhere Outdoors uh just keep in mind after about 3:00 we'll start to have more widely scattered showers and thunderstorms with the best coverage between about 5 and 8 here's a look at 5:00 today tonight rather I notice pretty widely scattered showers and storms carrying Heavy Rain Gusty wind some frequent lightning and then it looks like a thunderstorm complex will become a little more organized and shift south of I 20 after Sunset still carrying that Heavy Rain Gusty wind frequent lightning no severe weather is expected today but some storms could become strong uh with again that Gusty wind being the primary threat if we do have any storms on the stronger side overnight we should be mostly quiet and tomorrow morning going out the door for work or maybe you're traveling back from the Fourth of July holiday we'll be dry warm and muggy with temperatures in the mid 70s going back closer to 80 by 9 but the green light for tomorrow morning's commute because we should be dry the afternoon though that story changes in fact I think tomorrow a little stormier than today 60% coverage of showers and storms feels like temperatures into the triple digits which will be the case today as well it'll also be very hot and hum humid with afternoon storms likely so that's the reason for our continuation of that firstt weather day into Monday now we will start to taper back the rain chances as we head into the middle of the week about a 40% chance Tuesday and then very isolated afternoon storms Wednesday through Friday and that will continue into the weekend so we'll start to head into a slightly drier trend for the forecast by the middle of the week but we'll still pick up just about half an inch to another inch of rain and I will say if you get caught under some of the thunderstorms the next couple of days you could pick up a half an inch to an inch of rain just within the half hour to an hour that they sit over you so this is kind of broad brushing the rainfall totals through the week this week um but still some beneficial rainfall nonetheless it looks like we'll still be in pretty good shape as we continue through the month of July when it comes to rainfall I do want to quickly talk about tropical storm Barrel because that is making its way very close to the coast of Texas already seeing some of those outer rain bands along the coast moving Inland uh the storm pretty disorganized it's not looking so well put together uh as it's making its way closer to Texas but it is forecast to rest strengthen back into a category 1 hurricane just before making landfall somewhere near Corpus Christie Galviston area and then it'll move through Houston as a tropical storm bringing very heavy rain some Inland flooding also potentially of course some storm surge along the coast of Texas and then it'll downgrade into a Remnant low as we make our way into the overnight hours Tuesday and it will continue into the Great Lakes region as a again Remnant low of this storm and bring very heavy rainfall in fact along the coast uh through the state of Texas really from Galviston all the way up towards Dallas they could pick up 4 to 8 Ines of rain with some locally heavy amounts especially along the coast and then even from Northern Texas into Arkansas uh parts of Missouri they could pick up anywhere between two to five inches of rain within a very short period of time so some flash flooding definitely likely along the central portion of the United States here at home we're going to be relatively untouched from this in fact as that storm moves North we'll get on the backside of that low so that could promote some drier air to usher in which could help keep our rain chances on the lower end especially we head towards the middle of the week so uh that's not necessarily the main driver of our drier forecast but it could at least partially impact Us in that way so not a flooding or storm threat but more so a drier air threat on the back side of that system here's a look at your first alert 7-day forecast so we have our first alert weather days today and tomorrow for the widely scattered showers and thunderstorms uh today mainly going to be an evening event so after 5 o'clock is when I think we'll see the best chance for showers and thunderstorms and then tomorrow same thing mainly after about 3:00 showers and storms fire up with heavy rain Gusty wind frequent lightning coverage goes down to about 40% on Tuesday it's going to be hot and humid regardless all week long and then we'll start to dry out by the middle of the week but just about an isolated afternoon storm every day through Saturday temperatures will go back into the mid to Upper 90s Thursday through Saturday so just kind of looking ahead as we shift our story back to the heat uh we will have uh the potential I think for another heat advisory late week where it feels like temperatures could go above 102 103 maybe even 105 in some spots uh so something we'll be watching for you really carefully um as everyone is making their way back to work and of course kids may be heading back to summer camp this week so just things to uh think about and that we'll be keeping a really close eye on for you all right thanks so much for spending some time with us this Sunday morning on Atlanta

BUT, my seniors made a request of me that I was so happy to fulfill for them, and this was the first ever Senior Atlanta BeltLine tour that was ‚ú®EXCLUSIVELY ‚ú® for members of the Fulton County Southeast Neighborhood Senior Center. As always, big thanks to the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership for all you do to make this event an engaging and enjoyable experience for our seniors.

If you have a call this number, 4146136000, you need to call this number, and sign up for your senior services. I saw you shake your hand like, I didn't know. So you need to call this number, and tell them, live in Multicount, or you're a senior, you want to get access to your senior services. They're going to ask you some basic questions. They're going to try to make sure you live in Multicount. Because you don't spin, because you count residents, taxpayers, dollars, all people, go live in Multicount. So they will ask you your address to verify, and then they'll ask you your data birth because they want to know how old you are because as you age, in place, you get even more access to more services. Okay, so you'll see a lot of stuff won here, but a lot of stuff is missing, because we can not even fit on the brochure everything that we offer.

Commissioner Natalie Hall of District 4, and The Beauty Industry kicked off the first episode of Women in Atlanta. It was a great conversation about uplifting and inspiring the community and how Women in Atlanta can be a part of the positive success. In this clip, Commissioner Hall discusses her Senior BeltLine Tour. Through her partnership with the Atlanta BeltLine Partnership, Fulton County seniors aged 55 and older are invited to a 3-hour tour of the 22-mile Atlanta BeltLine. This interactive, guided tour not only showcases the BeltLine‚Äôs contributions to our communities but also teaches seniors how they can actively participate in BeltLine activities.

live out here [Music] today as long as the Israelites keep making babies if we don't follow the Commandments of the most high God and turn back to him we're going to continue to go through those curses but that's how we know who the real isra are up you see what I'm saying but the two biggest religions H you back H are right Christianity and the Muslim religion or Islam that's how we know that these apply to our people so we got here we got to get away from because that's to slaver makees sense brother but hey everybody all together repeat after me Barakat yahwah Barakat yahawashi right I just want to say the of yahwah right the yahwah M tariah right tariah your right that means the water of yahwah for putting his enemies into our hands man right the brother called you out he came up to the camp just to speak with you the brother yaju right I guess he wanted to contend something with you at look at look at well everybody on the corner that's teaching the Bible is a false prophet you said what everybody that's teaching the Bible is a false prophet okay so we don't supposed to believe in the Bible I didn't it say that the Bible has no prop interpretation and the Bible also say lean not to th own understanding correct yeah it say that okay so where does understanding come from it come from the Torah God the Torah is God or the Tor no no no no I say it come from the Torah our understanding come from the Torah which God gave I know but you can't get understanding from the book did did you hear my answer though yeah okay so this is what I'm saying God said that the Torah is our understanding so our understanding comes from the Torah which came from God no the law came from Moses did you hear what I said I'm I'm going to repeat it again I'm going to say it one more time just so we clear you said where do understanding come from I said the Torah which came from God and you're trying to dismiss the book that God said that understanding would be in how does that make sense okay so if everybody everybody who read the Torah get understanding we when did I say that I said our understanding you ask me where my understanding come from I'm going to repeat it one more time my understanding come from the Torah right because you can't hear obviously your ears closed right so look our understanding come from the Torah which comes from God it's plain and simple and you're trying to dismiss where God himself said the understanding com from because it's in his book am I correct no understand don't come from the book okay what did God say it come from the lip of the messenger okay so is it not written in the book oh that's not so so nowhere in the Bible it tells us to read a book no okay give me Revelation it don't tell you to read to get understanding you have to hear to get understand give me Revelation one whoever got who get it from whoever get it from this Revelation 1 verse 5 Revelation 1 verse 5 from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loveth us and wasth us from our sins I'm sorry verse three go ahead Revelation 1:3 blessed is he that readeth it say what blessed is he that readeth it said blessed is he that readeth read and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand so it said the time is at hand bless are those who read the prophecies which from from the Torah all the way to revelation we see books within this Bible that God spake right Sor right but yet you're trying to make me interpret the Bible that you're telling me not to read that don't make sense so what you just read it says what read bless that read and hear so our standpoint was you can't read and get understanding that's why I say read and hear so who are you hearing the words from whoever speaking in this Bible you don't hear a book talk hold the book can we go to Malachi 2: 7 you can go to okay let's go let's go to Malachi 2:7 right quick who you supposed to listen to you yeah Christ let's go to Malachi 2 and7 so uh hold on let me let let me read before before you read I just want to clarify you listen to the you listen to the anointed one so you're the anointed one yeah okay so um we in Malachi I'm going to read two verses we in Malachi 2 I'm going read verse 6 you is go ahead I'm going read I'm going read verse 6 and 7 hold up hold up D hold up so it says the law of Truth was in his mouth the law of Truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found on his lips and he walked with me in peace and iniquity and did turn many away from iniquity okay so hold on hold on I ain't finished I ain't finished it says let me ask a clarifying question hold on let me I got one more scripture okay okay it says for the priest's lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth so where should you seek the law at according to the to the writings I literally just showed you that it's in the Torah and you should seek the law at his mouth where for he is for he is the messenger of the Lord so it's the the priest the priest that God anointed read it one more time for me the priest lips hold on how is it plural for the priest's lips okay so there obviously there's more than one person that I can listen to outside of this [¬†__¬†] who's telling me that he's the anointed he went to a verse and cut his own self it said the priest plural lips meaning the N the the [¬†__¬†] who wrote the Bible in the Torah right the people who the Lord set up them the people we listen to not some [¬†__¬†] with some small ass head skinny ass legs who didn't already transgress right and having to stop himself from transgression when it said the Messiah in iniquity right now wearing no fringes got some baby ass r on with some ankle tall ankle socks on this is the [¬†__¬†] we supposed to follow he go to a verse and cut himself hey he going to turn this

scarecrow yes I asked where it was in that first though stupid no your point is you don't have a point should I expect him to have a point should I expect him to have comprehensive skills he follows this guy right go ahead read it is talking God is talking we don't have power we have t-shirts on God is talking listen to God God is talking go ahead so it says it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's House should be established in top of the mountains okay the mountain of the Lord's House what is that that's the vessel that God is dwelling in okay show me where is That's The Vessel cuz last time I check there was a temple that was built on a hill there was a literal Mountain where God built his Temple his house I know that for a fact that's a geographical fact that's a historical and archaeological fact you can look at it right now and tell a ride right so I know that's a fact where does it say anything about a vessel okay so right now why why does it say the mountain will be established let me finish let me finish show me that the mountain is the vessel sir hey that's what you have to do but we can't move past the mountain if you can't show me that it's the vessel that God is dwelling in cuz you're trying to convince me that God is inside of you personally right now and you're the person no no I ain't trying to convince you no no no no no no no no no I'm not trying to convince you I'm here to prove you to be false that's what I'm here to do so prove that it says Mountain means the vessel that God is going to dwell in where is Mount Zion in Israel okay so okay so why does Mount Zion have to be established in the last days because it's been laid waste for the last 2,000 years since 70 AD when Titus bestan sacked it and destroyed it and brought the oblation and sacrific thece like the prophecy inel n say sir that's why so they destroyed a physical Mountain that's what you saying they destroyed the temple that sat on top of the mountain and destroyed all the buildings that surrounded it just like what Christ said there shall not be one building here standing as the prophecy said hey okay so where does the New Jerusalem come from brother I need you to show me that is the vessel notice you're now trying to tell the whole no you're the burden of proof is on you to show me that the mountain is a person go ahead okay it says show me one in the bible let let me let me read it let me read it I need I need you understand what I'm asking you to prove here I'm ask you to give me one example of a human being being called a mountain in the Bible go ahead King so it says it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's House should be established on top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and All Nations shall flow unto it yeah the next verse many people shall go and say Come Ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach us his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of Zion shall go forth the law uhuh and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem the word of who the Lord subject matter of the Lord the most high God that's his word that's the path the people are going to go in that's the ways that all people are going to learn everybody's going to keep the Torah the Commandments of God that's what that's saying that you are everybody that you're that God is willing in you and everybody has to listen to you that's not what it's saying okay okay well let me say this nowhere close so when it says right here Matthew 12:8 it says hold on before we go to Matthew we got to get there I ask you a question I'm not going no well I I've asked you a question that you haven't ventured to answer I'm giving you a precept okay now is Matthew 12 and8 call a person a mountain yeah it's going to call the son of man who is Lord okay let's go it says Matthew 12:8 it says for the son of man is Lord okay okay no but I ask you a mountain a mountain man is called Mountain that's what I asked you that's what you're venturing to prove right now there's no disputation is whether the son of man is Lord plenty of people are called lord all throughout the Bible right that's an English translation title there's only one person that's called lord which trans translates to the Hebrew as the Tetra gritting yahwah there's only one person that that's true of right which is God so right now the Lord right there is simply a title right meaning Master ruler leader Chief Etc that didn't prove to me that a man was a mountain is what I asked you if you could show me in the Bible where a man is called a mountain I'll appreciate it cuz that's what you're if you don't understand that the mountain brother if you to me I'm supposed to understand it if you're the if I'm supposed to if I'm to get understanding from you right you're supposed to make me to understand that a mountain is a person that's what your job is right now nothing else hey

most high I'm standing on the most highest mountain that's why I read you the verse where it says God God house will be established above the mountains uh-huh what's that mean that mean that's the one that has the higher understanding above all the rest of the schools of thoughts okay okay so show me a man being caught a mountain in the Bible one time you show it I just no it's a man no it's a man standing on the mountain no it says the mountain of the Lord shall be exalted is the house okay show me the a house yes because the temple of God sits on a mountain no the temple is the vessel God's spirit dwells in it says God does not dwell in temples made with man hands so okay so what does God's spirit dwell uhhuh in everybody and everything all of life so God's spirit is in everybody out here let's give wisdom of Solomon 13 God's spirit is in everybody out here yes I'm going prove it to you in the Bible so why the H they condemning everybody else so you telling me everybody walking up

Incorruptible Spirit God's Incorruptible Spirit holy spirit is what is in all things or else how can that Gras go if God's spirit if it ain't connected to the power source how is it alive okay so so in Genesis brother let me ask you this let's say I believe you on the mountain is a vessel prove to me you're the vessel go let's go to Second Edris chapter [Music] 2 well no [¬†__¬†] that saying re he's saying that that dude right there is the most high I want that's Jesus right there y'all that's what he's trying to convince us that when you read the Bible it's talking about I just want everybody to be clear on that he's coming out here to try to convince me that he's Jesus and he's been coming out here weeks trying to do it and still ain't i' been debating this [¬†__¬†] for eight

I'm not here to I'm I'm not here to prove to you who I am I'm here to prove to you to that you're a false prophet okay so that's what I'm here to do prove that you're the vessel okay so I'm in second Edis I'm in Chapter 2 uhhuh I'm in verse 42 uh-huh let's get 7 when it when it tells about he who who his son is go ahead it says I Edis saw upon Mount Zion uhhuh a great people so Edis saw upon Mount Zion a great people uhhuh people were standing so it wasn't a building right people were standing there yeah okay okay no I need it's you that's the point whom I could not number uh-huh and they all praised the Lord with songs uh-huh and in the midst of them there was a young man of higher stature hold on hold up let can I hold up taller come here come here he said you said what there was a young man of higher stature of what taller than all the [Music] rest you said what than all the rest taller it say what one more hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up my statue it say what my statue is taller than you say what my statue is taller than you I can't tell okay I can't tell so let me let me let me finish reading so it says hold on hold on hold on hold on hold hold I can't person is taller it's a taller it's a doer it's a dollar hold up hold up hold up hold up hold on hold on let's let's hold up hold up let's see how ignorant he is what hold up hold up where somebody

it says hold up it says and in the midst of them there was a young man let's read the the definition of statue y'all the definition of statue is n a person's natural height a person's what height a person's natural height spiritual height a person's natural height metaphorical height a person's natural naturally you're not the tallest so stop that that's done okay okay so that's done okay so you telling me one go ahead okay so you telling me Christ is taller than everybody on Earth I mean according to that prophecy yes according to the prophecy or what you know tell me what you know according to the prophecy that you just read yes so Christ is tallering everybody on Earth yes when he's giving them crowns out he'll be tall than everybody yeah so so how tall he going to be then 12T I don't know he going to be taller than Shaq then right he going to be taller than [Music] Shaq okay so let me let me finish then if that's what you believe so it says I did believe what the book say it says taller than all the rest and upon the head of everyone he placed a crown and every it says and was ever more exalted and are Mar at greatly so I asked the angel say Sir what are these so does not Christ give us crowns to become priests or you make yourself a priest hey brother I need you to prove that that's you man you asking me that question prove that that's you you Ain get who you gave a crown to I give my crowns to the ones that I anoint that's a crown right there yeah you got a crown okay that's the crown get that out the the crown is information the crown is information can you show me that the crown is information I don't need you to say it I need you to demonstrate let's go to symbolic of information I would appreciate [Music] that let's go to Revelation 5 and9 yes sir cuz Christ comes with a new song so we read Revelation 5 and9 it says and they sung a new song saying thou are worthy to take the book and open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and every tongue and every nation okay so how have you have you shed your blood for for us My Flesh and Blood represent my life no no no no no no hold on hold on on it says the blood right so so your life how how is your life shedded The Blood Brother this is why the book is Seal because to me I just told you what do you mean what about your life equates to that that's why that's why I say eat Christ flesh and drink his blood right okay so explain how that works explain how your life equates to that that's what I'm asking I just and they sung a new song you just say your life again how do how in your life have you somebody ask me a question don't want to listen I'm asking I just told you if somebody my life life what about your life my life represents my blood okay so how have you shed your blood in your life what does that mean that metaphor I just told you no you Ain told me all you saying is my life anybody that just say my life what about your life demonstrates that what in your life blood have you shed I I'm worthy to take the book and I get crucified by y'all which cuz y'all tongue is a sword right your tongue is a sword so Christ crucifixion is humiliation it says you put Christ to open shame okay so you're the only niggaer that's been humiliated I didn't say that but I'm the only [¬†__¬†] that's Christ oh you said what I'm the only I'm the only [¬†__¬†] that's Christ he is the only [¬†__¬†] that's Christ this yeah it's only one are you Christ of course I'm Christ oh you are yeah all of us are Christ so all of y'all Christ what does the word Christ okay hold up what is the word Christ anointed one anointed anointed one and no it don't mean anointed one it means anointed okay so who anointed you it means oil so who anointed you a high priest so who anointed you a high priest what was his name Kahan okay so so so I want to ask you this in front of everybody okay twice okay so I want to ask you this are you are y'all 144 I mean it's not 144 [¬†__¬†] saying here so how can I no I say are are you of the 144 I'm I'm hoping okay you say you're hoping right of course if you if you was Christ you know that Christ said he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved it ain't I can't give myself ticket for a plane that ain't been issued yet okay so I want to read Revelation 5: 10 it says and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests so you a priest right of course did the have did the lamb make you a priest we'll see no so you're not a priest then oh hold on is there two different priesthoods that are spoke about in the Bible there's an order of mezc and there's an order of Levi right but who who purifies Levi the messenger so which which Christ identifies as John the Baptist so the messenger you talking about so so John the Baptist purified you no when are the Levites going to be purified before the kingdom is implemented that's Ezekiel 44 that's not what we're talking about so so you tell me about in this time we can't talk about what's going to happen in the future so so right you telling me the Levites got to be purified right yes there's a purification Levites so are you of the Levites of course I'm a so you need to be purified right of course and you're not going to be so that mean so why you all here teaching people if you need to be purified because I'm commanded to teach people you commanded to teach people and you not purified who's going to P wait wait hold on hold on so you going to purify me hold you going are you going to purify me yeah correct how you going to purify me the truth the new song okay teach me the new song Purify Me how can I teach you the new song come on I mean you you the teacher teach me the new song come on I I I just been telling you you don't get the law from the book you get the law from the mouth of the messenger okay give it to me go ahead you can't offer God bread if you haven't been purified so the first thing you got to do and stop offering the bread of God as you've been commanded in the law okay okay and then you can be purified day by day what's the bread of God the bread of God is going to come from Heaven okay so here's the problem with that the bread of God in the in the case of the biblical priesthood is literally the bread of God literally bread that was made the bread that David ate hey can can you get the script what is so so so so that's talking about a function in the literal Temple hold up hold up I'm not doing that okay so you telling me the bread was not the the teachings of the scribes and Pharisees the bread was not the teachings of the spies and Pharisees no to be clear that's not the bread that the Levites offered the bread that the Levites offered was the actual bread the showbread so you telling me to showbread I can go get God show bread from Kus that what you telling me no you we can't we don't have a temple to go get God showbread out to even thank it so that's not so so you telling me guard bread can go in the oven you can put guard bread in the oven that was unlawful for him to eat because they didn't know what did David eat that was unlawful for him to eat they didn't know David was the anointed one so when David went into the temple he grabbed the showbread just like they didn't know David was qualified to defeat the giant all his brothers laughed at him you know like you laughing at me so so why did God kill the high priest and let David eat the bread why did he kill him yeah because he tried to stop David from eating the bread he gave it to David no‚Ä¶ ",no

Neighbors say they hope there will be enough safety measures to keep drivers, cyclists and pedestrians safe. Now, we spoke with one woman who says this is personal. My father was actually hit by a semi crossing a road when he was on the Silver Comet Trail and they even had a little crosswalk sign up. He was listening to headphones and just walking and it didn&#39;t occur to him. So 11 alive did reach out to the Path Foundation to ask about safety measures that they plan to implement in the building out the connector trail, but we haven&#39;t heard back. We of course, will let you know when we do.

majority of my returning viewers haven't subscribed to the channel if you do enjoy this content please hit that subscribe button it does help us out and of course y'all know I appreciate y'all look I'm ready man fair warning so far uh two for two um actually Vin Halen hardly missed like hardly missed um it's interesting whenever I ask like what's your favorite track from these albums just to see the uh different type of people and the different type of tracks that they're choosing uh it's always interesting to me some would be like well this is my favorite off the album some would be like this is my least favorite uh it's it's always dope but let's let's get into it let's go ahead and [Music] listen woo all right you centers [Music] swing danger in the rear view Mir there's trouble in the Wind at that's bringing up the rear the menaces through SK she looks so [¬†__¬†] good so sexy and so frail something got the bite on me I'm going straight to hell and now we wasting time now wasted time more make up more make up L and you [Music] keep I'll come back to your senses baby we can't come to t i almost chased it in Bur he be simp pretty but try to take the F wearing out my welcome yes I better sa my praise now we're wasted time now we're Wasted timeck up say more pick up L you keep trying you keep trying [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] soon you'll

pick up L same more pick up line and you keep trying bu you keep [Music] [Music] trying [Music] yo yo I might be evil every time I hear every time I hear uh uh every time I hear um rth um every time I hear David Lee rth just saying rth just sounds awkward right I was about to say David Lee down like let me just say the last thing anyways every time I hear um Mr rth a cuss I chuckle a little bit cuz I'm just like you don't really hear um a lot of cussing like you know in rock and roll um music as much as they were so witty with cuz a lot of that stuff they wanted it to be played on the radio right so they they're really witty with with the way they say their things V Halen apparently didn't give a [¬†__¬†] and I like that if y'all know me if y'all know me y y'all know you know uh my language is a little bit on the Rough Side look I love the swing of this I no pun intended I love the swing of this um and I think this this song challenged the drummer right the speed the was amazing but yet it still had like a lot of wit to it um a lot of a lot of Rhythm [¬†__¬†] Eddie losing his [¬†__¬†] mind in there and the Charisma of Mr rth is just it's just impeccable it's just really impeccable and I feel like uh songs like this from V Halen these are Timeless songs man like this is there's not a time that when you listen to this you're not going to think oh this [¬†__¬†] is [¬†__¬†] fun this [¬†__¬†] is fun and that's what I'm getting from this album right last album was fun too like but all of these albums I feel like they're elements right this album do sound very very very fun like they were having a great old [¬†__¬†] time and what I love about Vin Halen is they try something new with every song right but of course once you hear that that that guitar you know what what um Eddie Van Halen's guitar sounds like it sounds like somebody with a pen just going just just just with a pin you feel me control chaos amazing that was fire so far um 3 for three three for three man we going to go four for four um like I said I'm going go back to all these albums I'm going listen to them again so I could you know your first listen to something you know first listen

Doug joining us now from northeast Atlanta. How are you making it out there? Doug, I feel compelled to report that the breeze that Ashley was talking about is blowing directly in my face right now. And if you see a little glistening underneath, uh, my eyeball, uh, it is uh, tears of joy because I love my job so much. Uh, we have talked a lot on this station about, uh how unpleasant the weather has been. Uh, the, the colder temperatures, how dangerous it can be. Um And tonight we found that in spite of all that people were still at least a few people out and about because hey, it is Saturday night in Atlanta. It&#39;s cold. I need a different word. Very nippy. Yeah. Frigid, uh, painful. This was the Atlanta Beltline downright empty compared to almost any other Saturday evening trying to get our exercise despite the weather. Yeah. Yeah. Was it tempted to just say No, not tonight. It was very tempting, but usually the beltline is just, you know, so packed on a Saturday. I saw that the sun was setting and then we was really just coming to shoot a couple of pictures. We spotted two different photographers capturing images of women modeling, not exactly Arctic style clothing. I feel good. I&#39;m just acting like it&#39;s not cold. Is it more important to be warm or to look great? Um I like to be comfortable, but I like to look good. I&#39;m gonna go in a warm anyway. So it&#39;s only gonna get colder right now. How would you describe the weather without using the word cold, bone chilling? I would agree with nippy freezing. It&#39;s, it&#39;s like froze. Definitely glad we came out, but I&#39;m definitely also excited to get back in as well. I hope tonight&#39;s weather coverage uh has moved you to tears as it has me. Uh I&#39;m gonna follow the advice of that. Last guy talked about how nice it was to get to be outside and how nice it will be to uh go in, see you all later live in northeast Atlanta. Back to you. Doug, Richards gracing us with your presence on a Saturday night, freezing his anatomy off. All right. Doug, thank you.

This 3-hour tour gives Fulton County Seniors the opportunity to see the growth and expansion of the Atlanta BeltLine, connect with neighborhoods throughout the city, and engage with each other through shared stories and experiences.

I am grateful for the continued growth and participation in this very popular event, and I look forward to getting even more seniors on the BeltLine next year!

Daylight saving time officially ends on Sunday at 2 a.m. But the changing time can create confusion among those who have dementia or Alzheimer&#39;s disease. It&#39;s called sundowning. And symptoms can include difficulty sleeping, anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, pacing and disorientation. You have less sensory input when the sun goes down. This is what the sun downing term refers to when the sun goes down, things get darker, they&#39;re more shadows. You can&#39;t interpret a process as well as you used to. But there are ways caregivers in families can help first keep a predictable routine. You wanna go to bed, get up and eat around the same times each day, next plan activities during the morning and early afternoon. So your loved one will be sleepy at night limit daytime, napping, caffeine and sugar and turn on a night light to help lower agitation. That may happen when it&#39;s dark and make sure that hearing aids and glasses, anything like that are close by to avoid additional sensory deprivation.

beltline grows here
in Atlanta, the people behind the project
say they are not considering
any alternatives to the light rail and street
routes that will run
along the path. An upcoming study is going
to look at the
best plans for a 13 mile rail corridor
right around the
belt line. It will look at transit
options from Lindbergh center station to
Bankhead and
nail down on the spots for stations along
the southwest and southeast
parts of the trail. Our partners at the Atlanta
Business Chronicle spoke to the head engineer of Atlanta
Beltline Incorporated. He says rail expansion is
essential as more people
are coming to
the city. Now, the study is going to take
about two years
and then it will be given to Marta who is

I put the key in the ignition I'm just kidding um I don't think you need to put the key anymore oh wow just have it here okay here we go oh is there a handbrake or something oh shoot oh very good here we go but where do we go this is actually orbi in my hometown of esky's tuna this is one of the most dangerous places in all of Sweden right there they're always they always shoot people there hello hey we're holding here maybe where I am today [Music] oh maybe I have we call me today first at all we're on the way now and it started raining like crazy again it's the first time I'm driving actually in a long time so hopefully we don't crash the road trip has started we're going to cardstock we were planning to drive half of the way but first a quick stop in another town no it's hailing

week out of oh yeah yeah I bet the insurance doesn't cover any damage the rain has stopped and we have driven about 30 minutes the hail storm now it's looking a bit better the sky looks a bit more blue I think it looked yeah it's looking pretty good now we are in our Brew at the pharmacy this is one of the biggest supermarkets here or like grocery stores Maxi Store Market today all right let's see it's like a huge uh grocery store we need to get some snacks here they have all the candy I don't know do they have these in the US where you can just pick the candy like this um they do but it's more like for nuts and seats there's all the candy it's more like Trail mixes how do you like the grocery store in Sweden um the um all the candy like the different types of candy and you can just get some we're gonna try to see if we can find um some snacks what's that plan thanks Maria now we're looking for a hotel in Carlsbad we only made it to other Brew so far or a brew this city is known to have like an accent where you sound really negative and whiny like you're whining also my hometown it's called everyone got a protein drink foreign here in Sweden a lot of Germans and danish people and like people from a bit further down south in Europe they come to Sweden they drive up along the west coast because the west coast of Sweden is really nice it has a bunch of unique Cliff formations and rocks from the Ice Age of Sweden there was an Ice Age here a long time ago and that formed all these rocks and it's also in general a very nice location so that's why people drive up the coast towards Norway and then all the hotels are fully booked in the summer here we go then in Carlsbad you're here [Music] we got a bit lost or we took the wrong turn against an hour off the highway on a gravel road so in Sweden you have to be 18 to get a driver's license but when you're 16 you can have a car with a big red triangle at the back of the car but you can only drive like 20 miles an hour you see those all over Sweden and then you if you're behind them you go super slow because they can't drive more than 20 miles an hour [Music] and at the finally arrived in Carlstadt located by one of the biggest lakes in Sweden [Music] we have arrived you and there's a swimming pool at the hotel but it's 70 barely 70 Fahrenheit outside like 18 Celsius so we have to do at least one little trick at the pool this is a restaurant we have arrived hotels.com room 411 we're going in the elevator foreign it's like uh quite a mediocre Hotel oh the toilet is nice actually and they have a they have a spa here a spa and a swimming pool so I'm for sure going to the swimming pool and then the spa I don't know if Maria wants to go to this bar I would love to go to the spa yeah let's go to this bar one good thing the bed is really soft here oh my neck has been hurting for months live so long and it's so soft and the pillow is good we have to try the pounds here maybe hey not that good of a reading actually it's soft but you can tell that it might break if your bones too much one bad thing in Sweden though is that the beds are always so narrow it's like two barely three feet wide and we're gonna put them together hopefully oh yeah we had a bit to eat uh I forgot to film the food but uh yeah anyways now I'm going to the to the relax here is the swimming pool and I relax on the inside looks quite cold in the pool here [Music] oh really cold swimming pool here not like when I was in Mexico where you had the deep frying here you get super cold in two seconds here is the jacuzzi wow it just sat and then there's also there's a bucket there that you can pour ice cold water over your head this kid did it like 20 times it was too cold so I'm going back up to Maria to take a shower fourth floor going up to the fourth floor again I'm back from the jacuzzi now I'm going to take a shower okay oh did you take a shower now oh [Music] oh [Applause] it's the end of this video now we are in Carlsbad as I said in the shine the sun came out for a little bit yeah we just showered but actually didn't do anything exciting we didn't even go to the downtown area because we will continue the

First Baptist Church holds for this community. I born and raised in this church and throughout 3 generations. Pastor Michael Sutton&#39;s family found a calling at the pulpit. The church is all about the community here in the West side of Atlanta. Dixie Hills First Baptist focuses on the neighborhood. But now the church, the one in need. We know the devil is by and we know that things don&#39;t sp because we are church mishaps, bad things. It&#39;s all around us. That reality closely felt after the church became a target. It said that someone wod try to destroy property on the church and it really don&#39;t care. All they was interested
in was getting that AC unit. Church member Reggie Smith poind to how thieves cut through padls stealing A5 ton air conditioner. Needed to cool classrooms in the fellowship hall, the church repairing the other units after thieves attempted to take those too. Of a nerve to steal from God&#39;s out. You really bold the sweltering summer heat adding to the heart of a loss of more than $10,000 money the church just does not have to spare Pastor Sutton holding on to
hope for a helping hand. Works in mysterious ways,I I know he will. He sure does. So church members are now doing what they can to keep operations going with the remaining AC uni. But they&#39;re hoping a more permanent solution comes with their 91st anniversary celebratn now less than a month away. For details on how you can donate and help them out, you can look for this

NBC&#39;s Matt Bradley has the details now from Seoul, South Korea. We just heard from a top United Nations general that they&#39;re starting a dialogue with the North Koreans about the status of Private Travis King. Now this is something of a breakthrough because it&#39;s the 1st signal that anyone has been able to reach the North Koreans ever since Private King bolted across the border nearly a week ago. We haven&#39;t heard from Private King himself, and top American officials have even said that they can&#39;t even reach the North Koreans now. All of this comes at a uniquely difficult time for American relations with North Korea now just in the past couple of days. U.S. Navy parked a nuclear powered submarine here in South Korea, and it came a couple of days after the US enraged the North Koreans by docking a nuclear armed submarine here. And in reaction, the North Koreans twice fired missiles into the ocean over the past week. Now the North Korea experts that I&#39;ve been speaking to say that the North Koreans are probably going to hold on to private king and exploit him for their own propaganda purposes. Now there&#39;s all sorts of of difficult questions around this. We don&#39;t know the fate of private. Thing but that UN General just today, so that he remains optimistic.

supone que es un hombre que tiene que estar a derecho un comisario mayor de la polic√≠a bonaerense que cuando lo vino a buscar la ley arranc√≥ a los tiros y le pegaron un tiro en un tobillo Qui√©n es el comisario centuri√≥n el comisario Francisco centuri√≥n es uno de los comisarios m√°s importantes que ahora hay que hablar en pasado ten√≠a la polic√≠a de la provincia de Buenos Aires era puesto por Bernie uno de los contactos entre la bonaerense e Interpol adem√°s hab√≠a estado trabajando y hab√≠a sido jefe de drogas il√≠citas de esa zona durante mucho tiempo se especul√≥ con que tambi√©n podr√≠a haber sido detenido o iba a quedar detenido el comisario centu Bueno lo que pas√≥ en las √∫ltimas horas es que efectivamente el doctor el fiscal hechazo orden√≥ la detenci√≥n del comisario mayor centuri√≥n cuando los fueron a detener intent√≥ escaparse de la Polic√≠a Federal a la Argentina como √©l es de elaborarse quien trabaja es otra fuerza intent√≥ escaparse la polic√≠a federal dispar√≥ un tiro para amedrentarlo al piso esa bala rebot√≥ y le peg√≥ en una pierna es una herida sin mayor gravedad Lo cierto es que ahora el comisario centuri√≥n tambi√©n est√° detenido y por qu√© est√° detenido est√° detenido porque cree la justicia que mantuvo en su casa encerrado a Lucas Escalante lo detienen por privaci√≥n ileg√≠tima de la libertad ah√≠ est√° el documento donde el juez de garant√≠as efectiviza la detenci√≥n de Francisco Alejandro centuri√≥n es el padre y t√≠o de los dos muchachos que son los √∫nicos por la desaparici√≥n de Lucas y lautaro los dos hab√≠an quedado se acuerdan que jugaba Argentina Lucas a lautaro para ir a festejar bueno M√°s all√° de eso la cuesti√≥n es que salieron los dos Esto es lo importante de la casa de lautaro Lucas lo pas√≥ a buscar con su auto no sab√≠an el destino exactamente algunos dicen que Lucas en realidad iba a la casa de centuri√≥n a cambiar unos vouchers de nafta que es esto son los vouchers de nafta que tiene la polic√≠a los venden a menor precio y le conviene aquel que lo est√° comprando Pero cosa que es un il√≠cito Qu√© pas√≥ a partir de ese momento desaparecieron los dos a los pocos adelantaron desaparezcan en plena democracia dos chicos y que otra vez las Mir√° este puesta en la polic√≠a el cuerpo del autor apareci√≥ [M√∫sica] que Esperamos que diga yo por ejemplo como madre de lautaro saber por qu√© mataron a mi hijo qui√©n lo mat√≥ Y por qu√© lo mataron Quiero saber d√≥nde lo llev√≥ Lucas Escalante quiero que cuenten a ver qu√© hicieron con Lucas Escalante para saber por qu√© apareci√≥ mi hijo la vera de la foto que est√° Buenos Aires la plata en las condiciones que apareci√≥ ustedes saben que mi hijo fue secuestrado fue torturado fue asesinado fue calcinado desapareci√≥ de la tierra son los que es para una madre saber que te arrebatan la vida de tu hijo que te vas a trabajar de venir a trabajar y que nunca m√°s lo volv√©s a ver es una de esas historias inc√≥modas que ponen en una situaci√≥n realmente muy inc√≥moda en tiempos de campa√±a electoral a cualquiera Porque si nosotros vemos que la sociedad producto del fracaso del progresismo impotente est√° girando a la derecha y frente al fracaso de las pol√≠ticas contra la inseguridad a la gente Empieza a pedir m√°s presencia policial m√°s mano dura y sin embargo crucen entiende que haya nada menos que un comisario mayor de la polic√≠a bonaerense detenido esta semana acusado de ser secuestrador y la historia no termina ah√≠ porque imaginen un rompecabezas de muchas muchas piezas de las cuales tenemos apenas algunas eso es este caso porque si empezaran a aparecer otras piezas tal vez nos enterar√≠amos que el comisario mayor centuri√≥n no solo tuvo como lo est√°n acusando ahora a una persona secuestrada sino que tambi√©n secuestr√≥ a esa persona trabajando para un grupo narco o para recuperar una camioneta cargada de coca√≠na entonces uno dice pero c√≥mo llega un comisario a hacer esto a convertirse en comisario mayor y haber era el comisario mayor jefe de delitos complejos hab√≠a sido jefe de drogas peligrosas en la zona sur y adem√°s ahora era el enlace con Interpol linda imagen para tener contacto con las diferentes polic√≠as del mundo con Interpol un tipo que ahora est√° preso acusado de haber secuestrado y posiblemente asesinado a dos personas yo les voy a contar un poquito esas pocas piezas de rompecabezas que se conocen las verdaderas y tambi√©n las conjeturales para que ustedes mismos tomen noci√≥n de la gravedad de esto sobre lo cual tambi√©n hay que decir que tuvo que intervenir el propio jefe de polic√≠a Ac√° tengo la declaraci√≥n del jefe de polic√≠a del comisario Garc√≠a porque el esc√°ndalo estaba escalando a un nivel que ya se pod√≠a convertir en un esc√°ndalo pol√≠tico insisto siempre estamos en √©poca de campa√±a electoral Pero vale la pena preguntarse C√≥mo se convierte un comisario mayor en esto en algo m√°s parecido un mafioso que alguien que tiene que estar trabajando para evitar delitos o por lo menos para que se cumpla la ley ustedes recuerdan la historia Lucas Escalante el autor Morelos salieron a festejar un partido una victoria de Argentina y desaparecen a partir de ah√≠ la investigaci√≥n se hace mal ahora se sabe que es investigaci√≥n se hizo deliberadamente mal por algo nosotros le fuimos contando ac√° que terminaron presos ahora salieron pero est√°n presos y procesados por encubrimiento dos comisarios y un principal de la polic√≠a bonaerense o sea hubo subalternos porque te Recuerden que esta es la comisario mayor que pusieron en juego su carrera para encubrir a centuri√≥n Y por qu√© solo por lealtades o hab√≠a plata en el camino a esta altura uno tiene derecho a preguntarse la fiscal que investigaba en el comienzo del caso que alguien digo tel√©fono para el procurador que entre par√©ntesis procurador es este contegranes de cambiemos y sin embargo tel√©fono para el procurador C√≥mo ten√≠a esta fiscal la fiscal Don Giovanni que no quer√≠a que investigara otra fuerza que la polic√≠a bonaerense ahora f√≠jense casi de casualidad consiguieron una c√°mara de seguridad de una estaci√≥n de servicio donde se ve√≠a al hijo del comisario centuri√≥n y a su sobrino ambos Cadetes de la polic√≠a bonaerense comprando bidones de nafta y por eso terminaron los dos presos acusado de haber participado al menos en el crimen de lautaro Morelos los encontraron comprando nafta despu√©s el auto apareci√≥ incendiado el cad√°ver de lautaro pareci√≥ este golpeado e incendiado no aparece Lucas Escalante y ahora vamos a volver sobre eso pero esa fiscal durante semanas y semanas y semanas Si nosotros estuvimos contando pero como si hay una disposici√≥n que dice que cuando interviene una polic√≠a tiene que investigar otra fuerza de seguridad Cuando lo sospechosos son de una polic√≠a tiene que investigar otra fuerza de seguridad sin embargo la fiscal quer√≠a seguir investigando con la bonaerense ahora se sabe que eso fue un encubrimiento porque hay dos comisarios presos por encubrimiento que desviaron la atenci√≥n la fiscal todav√≠a sigue en su puesto dijo no bueno fue impericia la tratan de cubrir entonces ah√≠ uno tiene que preguntarse Che este c√≥mo cuando los polic√≠as son los que encubre van presos cuando son los fiscales lo que encubren no es impericia Pobrecita inexperiencia o ten√≠a miedo de la bonaerense O estaba de acuerdo con el encubrimiento de la bonaerense con lo cual en ambos casos se Tendr√≠a que ir a su casa Pero sigue sentada ah√≠ pero sigamos adelante porque las familias fue la que ven√≠a aqu√≠ al living de GPS a decir esto no cierra por ning√∫n lado no se Avanza en la investigaci√≥n despu√©s se supo que a esa familia los estaban durmiendo los estaban enga√±ando iba el comisario de la comisar√≠a de bosques que termin√≥ preso y le dec√≠a no mire seguro su hijo est√° por ah√≠ desnudo con dos Minas y nunca m√°s apareci√≥ apareci√≥ muerto despu√©s iba el comisario saracho que era el que hab√≠an puesto el jefe de la dni de ah√≠ en la zona de quilmes hab√≠an puesto para que investigan el expediente se juntaba con la familia y le pateaba la pelota afuera todo el tiempo tambi√©n termin√≥ preso tambi√©n est√° acusado de encubrimiento pero esta semana cuando fue detenido centuri√≥n se conoci√≥ un dato apenitas porque la manera el escrito al cual accedimos en el cual lo acusan a centuri√≥n y le dicen que est√° acusado de haber tenido por lo menos un mes secuestrado obviamente a Lucas Escalante porque lautaro morelo cuerpo lautaro morelo apareci√≥ y Lucas Escalante nunca apareci√≥ Y entonces ah√≠ uno dice pero c√≥mo el fiscal lo est√° acusando el comisario mayor de haber secuestrado a Lucas Escalante d√≥nde En esa quinta donde inexplicablemente todav√≠a segu√≠a viviendo El comisario esa quinta que nosotros aqu√≠ tambi√©n la mostramos esta que ustedes est√°n viendo que uno dice c√≥mo hace un comisario para tener semejante rancho medio ca√≠do no hay que era para una casa para una revista de decoraci√≥n medio ca√≠do pero ah√≠ hab√≠a electrodom√©sticos muebles hab√≠a cantidad de cosas que no se explicaban porque estaban ah√≠ el allanamiento lo hizo la polic√≠a bonaerense lo hizo mal no se no se consiguieron buenas pruebas pero as√≠ Todo se sabe que Lucas y lautaro fueron a esa quinta porque ah√≠ se pierde la se√±al de celular porque se los ve en una c√°mara de seguridad y porque como estaban perdidos si no encontraron el lugar le preguntaron una persona que despu√©s sali√≥ de testigo Entonces ese lugar incre√≠ble O sea la casa del comisario imag√≠nense si en la casa de cualquiera de nosotros desaparecen dos personas que no pasar√≠a a nosotros nos meten preso al comisario centuri√≥n no lo met√≠an preso Imag√≠nese si adem√°s el hijo y el sobrino del due√±o de esa casa aparecen comprando bidones de nafta el tipo tendr√≠a que estar preso no como era un comisario de la bonaerense no lo llevaban preso porque investigaba la propia polic√≠a bonaerense y entonces no no hab√≠a pruebas hasta que en un momento dado por presi√≥n pol√≠tica o alguien dijo Che basta esto es un papel√≥n y tuvieron que pasar otros tres Fiscales Porque todos se inhib√≠an vienen el miedo que le tienen a los a lo que se llama Los porongas de la bonaerense porque hay que decir que Francisco centuri√≥n coco centuri√≥n era un verdadero [¬†__¬†] de la bonaerense un tipo con poder Tanto poder como para que haya dos comisarios que quieran y que jueguen su carrera que va a terminar tirada por la borda un evidente encubrimiento ahora el cuarto fiscal lo acusa de esto insisto es un comisario mayor es un tipo que hizo carrera en la bonaerense y ahora est√° convertido en esto sus traducciones de caudales p√∫blicos en curso real con privaci√≥n ilegal de la libertad D√≥nde est√° las instrucciones de caudales p√∫blicos esta se dir√≠a que la m√°s boluda porque porque el hijo de centuri√≥n lo tent√≥ a Lucas escala antes dici√©ndole venir que nos juntamos que yo tengo vales de nafta y con eso vale de nafta y ah√≠ se supone que ese fue el se√±uelo para que fueran iba y Lucas Escalante con su BMW con azul Francia finalmente termin√≥ yendo lautaro Morelos eso alter√≥ la situaci√≥n Porque sospechan que lo que quer√≠an era el otro cargo secuestrarlo a Lucas Escalante para qu√© ahora se lo vamos a analizar por lo menos en t√©rminos de hip√≥tesis pero este es el cargo al comisario centuri√≥n esto se conoci√≥ esta semana lo nuevo es esto privaci√≥n ilegal de la libertad agravada por haber durado m√°s de un mes y por ser cometida con violencia lo est√°n acusando un comisario mayor de la herencia de haber secuestrar a una persona durante m√°s de un mes donde bueno en principio en esa quinta que yo le mostraba reci√©n porque de ah√≠ desaparecieron lo inexplicable que el comisario todav√≠a no fuera preso imag√≠nense insisto si cualquiera de nosotros vienen dos personas una a una la matan la otra desaparece y mi hijo y mi sobrino son los que aparecen comprando los bidones de nafta con lo cual el auto termina incendiado y el cuerpo de una de las v√≠ctimas aparece incendiado y todo eso sucedi√≥ en mi casa a m√≠ me meter√≠an preso al comisarios centuri√≥n no lo met√≠an preso raro raro pero bueno finalmente aqu√≠ est√° centuri√≥n amag√≥ con disparar o amag√≥ sal√≠ corriendo del casualidad le pegaron un tiro herido en el tobillo un hombre de 50 a√±os varias cajas fuertes porque si hay algo que los comisarios de la bona erense tienen son varias cajas fuertes siempre nada de la plata no bancarizada esto tiene que ser bien negra Bien enterrada viene escondida tobillo herido del comisario centuri√≥n pero ahora les voy a mostrar un documento exclusivo que no se conoc√≠a porque hay que decir que la causa empieza a avanzar Pese a que la fiscal quer√≠a seguir investigando con la bonaerense alguien que fuera menos que el jefe de polic√≠a le llam√≥ la atenci√≥n este manejo y esto arranc√≥ en diciembre en marzo m√°s o menos pero espere que yo le digo cuando fue la declaraci√≥n en marzo abril el 18 de abril el comisario general El jefe de polic√≠a Daniel Garc√≠a alfino Garc√≠a Daniel Garc√≠a El fino Garc√≠a se presenta en el expediente y declara ante los fiscales y declara esto que yo les voy a leer le pregunt√© a Hilario Escalante o sea est√° contando una reuni√≥n que tuvo con la familia de Lucas Escalante Hilario Escalante es el padre y dice este insisto la declaraci√≥n de un jefe de polic√≠a o sea vean Qu√© raro que bizarro Todo esto le pregunt√© el √°rea Escalante sobre la sexualidad de su hijo y seguidamente Hilario me refiero y me dice sabes que s√≠ haciendo alusi√≥n que Lucas era gay o sea el padre est√° diciendo que Lucas Escalante era gay que en ese momento en ese momento la propia hija lo para el padre si quieres s√≠ pap√° entonces primera cosa rara el padre quer√≠a abonar la hip√≥tesis sexual sobre la cual ya se hab√≠a trabajado mucho antes la hija le dice haciendo alusi√≥n a que Lucas la hija lo para diciendo qu√© dec√≠s pap√° entonces empiezan a hablar entre ellos Hilario en un determinado momento hace alusi√≥n de algo que le encontraron O vieron que seguidamente Hilario refiere que Lucas le hablaba de cu√°nto calzaba centuri√≥n haciendo referencia a su √≥rgano viril masculino presten atenci√≥n a esto a la actitud de Hilario Escalante porque es uno de los puntos de sospecha sobre el cual vamos a volver pero esta es una de las hip√≥tesis que plantea el jefe de polic√≠a en este mismo escrito el jefe de polic√≠a cuenta que √©l tuvo que hacer algo que no hab√≠an hecho los fiscales o mejor dicho la fiscal Don Giovanni la que no quer√≠a investigar y fuese le present√≥ el comisario centuri√≥n y le dijo Dame el celular o sea lo que debi√≥ haber hecho la justicia insisto hab√≠an detenido a los dos muchachos con los bidones de nafta los hab√≠an visto en la c√°mara de seguridad los hab√≠an metido presos por haber incendiado acusado de la del crimen y la desaparici√≥n de Lucas Escalante el aut√≥nomo Morelos sin embargo al padre que era el que el due√±o de la casa donde desaparecieron no le sacaban ni siquiera el tel√©fono y hasta la semana pasada segu√≠a siendo polic√≠a segu√≠a siendo comisario Bueno ahora van a ver la otra parte porque esta es una de las hip√≥tesis el jefe de polic√≠a dice le saqu√© el celular cuenta esta reuni√≥n con la familia y Ac√° est√° la segunda hip√≥tesis que esta es la que va quedando y esto ac√° s√≠ estamos entramos en una trama que es esto que yo les digo c√≥mo un comisario mayor de la polic√≠a bonaerense Pero puede pasar con cualquier otra polic√≠a no me extra√±ar√≠a que pasa lo mismo la polic√≠a de Santa Fe de C√≥rdoba de neuqu√©n se convierten en esto C√≥mo llegan si se convirtieron en esto como ascienden es en la reuni√≥n que mantuve durante el mes de marzo aproximadamente con los familiares la primera reuni√≥n donde hablaban de la hip√≥tesis sexual fue en diciembre Esta es una reuni√≥n en mes de marzo tres meses despu√©s Les hice referencia a las hip√≥tesis que yo manejaba desde mi punto de vista y as√≠ mismo les refer√≠ que estamos investigando una causa por el robo de una camioneta blanca que se investiga en una Fiscal√≠a de la plata con el doctor garganta nos queda con no consta en el expediente pero dicen los que estaban en esa reuni√≥n que al menos una de las personas de los familiares que Escucha hablar de la camioneta blanca se sienten muy mal queda como estupefacto no importa o sea no Este es un dato de color Si se quiere no tiene relevancia en el expediente pero t√©nganlo en cuenta vuelve la cuesti√≥n de la camioneta blanca insisto estoy ley√©ndole no estoy leyendo un testigo de identidad reservada esto dice el jefe de polic√≠a jefe polic√≠a el fino Garc√≠a es el que mete la hip√≥tesis de la camioneta blanca en abril y a ver bueno a ver vuelve m√°s adelante y dice que en la reuni√≥n dice que respecto a la hip√≥tesis del robo de la camioneta blanca me refer√≠a a que hay una informaci√≥n que Escalante o sea el padre tendr√≠a algo que ver en esa causa que por la venganza del robo de esa camioneta le secuestraron al hijo de Hilario Escalante pero esa investigaci√≥n se lleva a cabo en la fiscal√≠a de la plata en la fiscal√≠a del fiscal √Ålvaro garganta Yo supongo que a esta altura esto es de hace un par de meses Yo supongo que a esta altura se debe haber unificado la investigaci√≥n y por eso avanzaron contra el comisario centuri√≥n sigue declarando insisto el jefe de polic√≠a que la hip√≥tesis de la camioneta sale de la dependencia donde trabajaba centuri√≥n por eso les dije que no la descarten pero que no vaya a ser cosa que quieran embarrar la causa Esta es la declaraci√≥n de un jefe de polic√≠a qu√© es lo que da para pensar y aqu√≠ s√≠ entramos en el terreno de la hip√≥tesis y bueno hab√≠a una camioneta con algo muy valioso qu√© es lo que se dice en el mundo del ampa que esa camioneta llevaba kilos de coca√≠na para qui√©n no se sabe que esa camioneta fue robada Y a partir de ah√≠ uno Mira hacia atr√°s y descubre que en el en el entorno de este ataque a Lucas y a lautaro con lautaro muerto y Lucas no se sabe d√≥nde est√° pero al comisario centuri√≥n lo acusan de haberlo tenido secuestrado por lo menos un mes hay otras escuchen bien tres muertes tres muertes una de esas muertes es nada m√°s y nada menos que la de alguien que se calcula que trabajaba como casero donde en esa quinta en esa gigantesca quinta claro una quinta con siete edificaciones no s√© cu√°ntos metros casi una manzana ac√° trabajaba un casero ese casero Aparece muerto en el semce pero el samce de la zona norte o sea estamos en Florencio Varela alguien llev√≥ a ese se√±or que trabajaba seg√∫n se piensa ac√° un hombre con antecedentes penales jardinero parrillero Entonces por qu√© lo ten√≠an laburando Aparece muerto en una pila de basura en el samce Al otro lado del Gran Buenos Aires qui√©n se llev√≥ un cuerpo desde Florencio Varela hasta el ciance hasta Norte hasta el camino del buen aire hay una explicaci√≥n que piensan que fueron dos polic√≠as con lo cual los polic√≠as no solo encubrieron y distrajeron la investigaci√≥n y extrajeron la familia sino que tambi√©n Hay polic√≠as involucrados en el descarte de un cuerpo pero eso no es todo porque Ahora recuerden que en se hablaba En aquel momento de la correlaci√≥n que hubo entre la desaparici√≥n de Lucas y lautaro y la aparici√≥n de dos cad√°veres quemados en una camioneta la autopsia demostr√≥ que esos dos cad√°veres que aparecieron quemados y que se confundi√≥ se pens√≥ que eran Lucas y lautaro en el momento y que eso tambi√©n era una pista falsa Ahora les voy a mostrar y les vamos a contar Por qu√© sabemos que es una pista falsa que nos quisieron plantar a nosotros ac√° en este programa esos dos muchachos murieron muchachos eran dos mec√°nicos que ten√≠an antecedentes penales que eran dos mec√°nicos picantes m√°s o menos tumberos murieron presentados vivos quemados en dentro de una camioneta en guernica qu√© es lo que sospecha ahora la investigaci√≥n teniendo en cuenta insisto lo que dice el propio jefe polic√≠a la camioneta blanca sospechan que esa camioneta blanca fue robada o como seguir√≠a en las jergas fue mexicanidad que estos dos mec√°nicos tuvieron participaci√≥n en ese robo y que despu√©s le encargaron le encargaron Al comisario centurio que recuperara esa camioneta como √©l por eso es que en la declaraci√≥n del fino Garc√≠a Ac√° est√° la camioneta quemada digo para que vean que no es un mito urbano eh Esta es la camioneta quemada donde aparecieron los dos cuerpos quemados vivos para que vean que todo esto no no es este un mito urbano sino que estamos intentando establecer una l√≠nea de punto entre las pocas piezas de este rompecabezas macabro que les estoy contando Recuerden que el que mete la camioneta robada como hip√≥tesis de algo que se sab√≠a en la propia dependencia de centuri√≥n es el jefe de polic√≠a se los Acabo de leer de su propia declaraci√≥n en el expediente se hace un testigo calificado el que dice en la dependencia de centuri√≥n se sab√≠a que hab√≠a una camioneta cargada no dice coca√≠na pero a ver qu√© puede tener una camioneta que la vuelva tan valiosa en el mundo del ampa obviamente unos cuantos kilos de coca√≠na que es la virtual moneda de cambio se pagan los trabajos con coca√≠na para qu√© era esa coca√≠na no se sabe Pero se sospecha que estos dos muchachos participaron del encubrimiento participaron del robo de la camioneta Y entonces por ac√° empieza la b√∫squeda qui√©n estaba a cargo de esa b√∫squeda qui√©n la estaba buscando desesperadamente lo hab√≠an contratado a centuri√≥n padre para que con sus conocimientos el mundo del ampa en la en la divisi√≥n narcotr√°fico en delitos complejos en el conocimiento de los comisarios zona Sur Buscar a esa camioneta Esto es lo que se est√° investigando a ver y como ya sabemos puede en las investigaciones judiciales puede pasar cualquier cosa que ahora aparezcan diciendo que no que el m√≥vil fue otro que lo desplacen para cualquier lado pero en la l√≠nea de puntos es bastante n√≠tida como para sospechar porque insisto la propia declaraci√≥n del jefe de polic√≠a la que pone como un posible m√≥vil esa camioneta blanca que el sentido com√∫n dice estaba cargada de coca√≠na por eso fueron a buscar estos muchachos porque piensan que tuvieron que ver los mataron no Encontraron la camioneta y siguieron buscando y ah√≠ es donde empieza la hip√≥tesis m√°s tremenda porque Recuerden que yo le dije que al final del expediente El comisario centuri√≥n est√° acusado de haber tenido un mes secuestrado a Lucas Escalante entonces piensa en la escena llegaron a la quinta a lautaro Seg√∫n dice la autopsia lo mataron en menos de 40 minutos le pegaron lo ahorcaron lo llevaron en el auto quemaron el auto quemaron su cuerpo el auto apareci√≥ quemado en un lado el cuerpo en otro Y entonces sospechan que Lucas Escalante estuvo por lo menos un mes secuestrado para qu√© Y por qu√© nadie pidi√≥ rescate O cu√°l era el rescate Y entonces ah√≠ es donde viene la duda Pero insisto es el propio jefe de polic√≠a el que mete la historia de la camioneta blanca en el expediente y ahora hay un silencio tremendo o sea habr√° unificado se habr√° unificado las dos causas y de la unificaci√≥n de las dos causas salen estos datos no lo sabemos pero volvamos al origen de todo esto puede Por qu√© un comisario mayor de La bonaerense pondr√≠a en juego su carrera su patrimonio ac√° mostr√°bamos reci√©n la quinta la vida y la c√°rcel y la libertad de su hijo y de su sobrino Por qu√© lo har√≠a solo por unos vales de nafta se sabe que a Lucas lo fueron a tentar lo buscaron por por Instagram lo buscaron por el BMW le hab√≠an hecho alg√∫n grado de inteligencia lo buscaron lo buscaron lo buscaron y lo tentaron para que viniera a esa quinta fue por los vales de nafta Se lleg√≥ hasta esa quinta por estos audios yendo para Varela olea hace un rato llega a casa me voy a quedar en casa viste Pero hay un chab√≥n que me dan hasta viste pero la tengo que ir a buscar hasta el alpino un poquito m√°s lejos pero bueno Bueno hasta gratis este y nada estoy yendo porque sino [M√∫sica] un Red trampa [M√∫sica] Ah No amigo yo pens√© que quer√≠as ir a alg√∫n lado No no estoy en mi casa perro s√≠ te quedas ah√≠ yo no s√© qu√© voy a hacer encima tengo que ir porque me van a regalar vale de nafta viste y cerca de tu casa encima [M√∫sica] estoy arrancando por all√° yo me he ba√±ado Me voy a acostado pero bueno era yo Porque te voy para Varela amigo te voy para Varela ahora y ah√≠ va para tu casa me queda ah√≠ si quieres y Bueno amigos si te joya una cajete t√≠o Ya s√© que lejos por mi casa pero vos sab√©s que vale la pena pero qu√© onda C√≥mo es la movida qu√© no est√° gratis C√≥mo es boludo o sea el chab√≥n porque tiene eso porque compr√≥ muchas canastas pero un par de vale por cortes√≠a esto [M√∫sica] ya estoy ac√° en ruta entonces fue por vales de nafta la acusaci√≥n dice sustracci√≥n de caudales p√∫blicos de la cual se acusa centuri√≥n claro por los vales de nafta pero esta es la m√°s boluda obviamente nadie insiste un comisario mayor no pone en juego su carrera su patrimonio la libertad de su hijo y de su sobrino por uno vale de nafta no cierra por ning√∫n lado Cu√°l era el verdadero motivo por el cual mataron un pibe y seg√∫n lo investigan tuvieron m√°s de un mes y medio secuestrado a otro porque ac√° hay que tener algo en claro comisarios centuri√≥n en estos meses no sali√≥ a proclamar su inocencia no dijo No todo esto es un malentendido no no se qued√≥ en la casita esperando a ver si pod√≠a zafar si pod√≠a mover el expediente por otro lado entonces uno dice Che y estos los comisarios este comisario se comporta m√°s como un mafioso que como un comisario volvamos atr√°s porque el expediente judicial en la justicia Argentina pueden pasar Milagros lo que nadie nos va a sacar de la cabeza es que un C√≥mo llega a comisario mayor un tipo que era capaz de hacer estas cosas de salir a buscar una camioneta porque estaba cargada de merca de plantar utilizar a su hijo de se√±uelo para traerlo a Lucas Escalante y despu√©s tal vez tenerlo un mes secuestrado y no se sabe d√≥nde est√° despu√©s ahora queda y ahora lo vamos a discutir ac√° con los muchachos as√≠ Bueno qu√© sabe el padre de Lucas Escalante Hilario Escalante porque figura como constructor un constructor bueno acaudalado no tiene ninguna relaci√≥n aparente con con nada que tenga que ver con el narcotr√°fico se equivocaron fueron a buscar la persona equivocada ten√≠an mal dato son enzimas son de mafiosos son tan torpes que secuestraron al tipo equivocado y lo hicieron desaparecer hay algo que nos cierra en todo esto y tambi√©n uno tiene que tener en cuenta un viejo una vieja cosa que yo aprend√≠ hace muchos a√±os Que proporcionara al esc√°ndalo es el encubrimiento Cuando algo se escandaloso cuando algo molesta a una estructura en este caso una estructura policial inmediatamente Aparecen las pistas falsas y aparece el encubrimiento y las distracci√≥n Y eso que hicieron hacer con este caso ac√° en Gps cuando est√°bamos al aire los primeros fragores de la desaparici√≥n de Lucas y lautaro y nos dicen que hab√≠an aparecido y que eran los que estaban en la camioneta Pero los que nos lo dijeron estaban muy cerca de la plana mayor de la polic√≠a bonaerense o sea nos plantaron una pista falsa as√≠ fue por una fuente oficial de que est√° en la investigaci√≥n s√≠ est√° confirmado los cuerpos encontrados dentro de la camioneta es lautaro morelo y Lucas Escalante ahora lo que queda por determinar c√≥mo llegaron Ah√≠ Y qu√© es lo que pas√≥ lo que a m√≠ me dice gente de la investigaci√≥n que no descarte el tema narcotr√°fico s√≠ a m√≠ lo que me dicen es no Descartes el tema narcotr√°fico porque la l√≠nea investigativa va por ese lugar y que los dos cuerpos encontrados en la camioneta pertenecen a lautaro morelo y a Lucas Escalante pero ahora se sospecha esta camioneta S√≠ tuvo que ver con el caso Qu√© pasa Qu√© fue lo que pas√≥ en aquel momento nahuel yo creo que fue una una causa que de Primer momento se embarr√≥ total pero total eso te voy a explicar por qu√© centuri√≥n cuando estaba a cargo de Interpol porque estaba a cargo una semana antes que lautaro el cuerpo de lautaro se ha habido a √©l ya lo hab√≠an mandado al banco de suplentes s√≠ Qu√© quiere decir esto cuando la fuerza ya saben de que vos vas a caer o algo va a pasar con vos te sacan y te resguardan te tienen ah√≠ si no pasa nada volv√©s y si pasa ya te hab√≠an movido a un dato interesante la declaraci√≥n el jefe de polic√≠a elfino Garc√≠a dice que no lo conoces la atenci√≥n a ver lo tiene que conocer porque es un comisario mayor yo pens√© lo mismo porque jefe de Interpol obviamente Habla con el jefe de polic√≠a el jefe de narcotr√°fico zona Sur tambi√©n Habla con el jefe de polic√≠a pero igual a favor del fin no te cuento que cuando dijo muchachos de ac√° para abajo lo que tiene que caer que caigan se destrab√≥ la causa claro el motivo por el cual lo llevan preso al comisario es por el celular cu√°l cuando alguno que es mucho que figura digo a ver son comisarios tiene que estar al lado de la ley pero que no falte un celular trucho Claro pero sabes qu√© pasa vos vas de ese lado y yo te digo ten√©s raz√≥n rolo te banco en esa pero guarda yo ya no compro nada con nadie con esta causa por lo que ha pasado por ejemplo uno me refrescaba reci√©n y me dec√≠a Che y no se habla del testigo que llev√≥ Hilario el pap√° de Lucas diciendo que hab√≠an participado de una fiesta sexual y que despu√©s las pruebas dieron de que no existi√≥ fiesta y las c√°maras Hilario lo llev√≥ Entonces no conf√≠o en absolutamente nada de ac√° lo que queremos saber es si se da por contado que estuvo un mes secundario o el padre es muy ingenuo y cree crey√≥ en la hip√≥tesis de la fiesta sexual o est√° c√≥modo con la versi√≥n de la camioneta blanca o presionado o presionado Por qu√© Porque si a vos te tienen un pibe tuyo un mes secuestrado y quiz√°s en ese mes tuvieron negociando y por ah√≠ gracias a Dios el pibe est√° comido en alg√∫n lugar bueno Esto es lo que no se sabe Tambi√©n total Porque adem√°s F√≠jate que no se habla no dicen dicen que adem√°s por de d√≥nde saquen la idea de un mes y se me estuvo un mes privado de la Libertad en esa quinta y por ah√≠ ha sonado ahorita que siempre Te escuchan por ah√≠ no figuran hay veces las escucha pero se escuchan muchas veces Bueno saltado en alguna de las escuchas que estaba por ah√≠ un golpe en alg√∫n celular conseguido claro ac√° tuvo muy embarrada mira que con Pablo con ponce√±o y la venimos laburando desde el primer d√≠a la causa de esta y cambiando informaci√≥n constantemente primero por qu√© tiene centuri√≥n tiene 29 causas abiertas en asunto interno y nunca la movieron Por qu√© un fiscal del 2016 a centuri√≥n est√° investigando por enriquecimiento il√≠cito y todav√≠a no sabe si si tiene o no tiene claro claramente entendemos de que estamos hablando era un muchacho [¬†__¬†] de la bonaerense a ver Carlos diegues es abogado de la familia de lautaro morelo est√° en el interior del pa√≠s por eso no est√° aqu√≠ con nosotros pero con √©l hemos hablado mucho sobre las cosas raras que hay en este expediente doctor Diego gra√±a le habla buenas noches Buenas noches Rolando es un placer bien qu√© de todo lo que contamos hasta ahora nos equivocamos desde el punto humilde mirada como creyente o sea como particular damnificado es coincido plenamente en todo por lo menos esas mi mirada y la mirada similar tiene tambi√©n Daniel hichazo venimos trabajando codo a codo con aparece en el expediente la camioneta la hip√≥tesis la camioneta blanca que pone el jefe de polic√≠a aparecen en varias hip√≥tesis Pero bueno hay alguna que otra que toma mucho m√°s firmeza lo cual no me puedo explayar en este momento porque a partir del d√≠a martes arrancamos con la segunda fase de la investigaci√≥n s√≠ O sea que la detenci√≥n del comisario puede dar un nuevo giro a la investigaci√≥n es muy factible cuando uno ve qu‚Ä¶ ,no longer

d√≠a vos lo dijiste en un cuartel de bomberos bombero que trabajan para la comunidad y los oportunistas de siempre los rateros porque esta persona ingresa por un port√≥n lateral ac√° en el fondo estamos con con Mart√≠n que nos va a contar c√≥mo fue todo esto Mart√≠n porque se dieron cuenta cuando faltaba la bicicleta qu√© tal Buenos d√≠as S√≠ exactamente uno de los chicos al due√±o de la bicicleta cuando se da cuenta viene me pregunta hacia la hab√≠a visto y me consulta por el tema si pod√≠amos Ver las c√°maras para para ver si se lo hab√≠an robado y s√≠ cuando miramos las c√°maras obviamente se la hab√≠an robado y hac√≠a 10 minutos qu√© aprovecharon un port√≥n lateral abierto entonces fue un compa√±ero sali√≥ le avisa en la cocina lo que estaban tomando mates y pod√≠an cerrar el port√≥n √©l lo deja apoyado y mientras √©l saca el auto y sale la persona est√° aprovecha y se mete y se lleva la bici ustedes qu√© piensan que eran alguien que estaba a la expectativa que conoc√≠a los movimientos de aqu√≠ para m√≠ Estaba la expectativas estaba en la plaza y vio y se fue adentro se meti√≥ entre el cuartel y se fue con la bici en realidad entr√≥ y se fue a una parte Cuando tenemos un pa√±al de herramientas y bueno y ah√≠ se ve que como estaba cerrado no no pudo hacer nada y se llev√≥ la bicicleta que estaba justo ac√° te est√° escuchando Eduardo Mart√≠n para cualquier consulta Hola Mart√≠n C√≥mo est√° la verdad que ins√≥lito no inesperado adem√°s contanos D√≥nde estaba la bicicleta justo qu√© la deja com√∫nmente apoyada ah√≠ s√≠ estaba en realidad al lado de la camioneta y como sacaron la camioneta hace un ratito la corrieron pero como est√° dentro del cuartel siempre est√°n las bicicleta ac√° o sea Y por d√≥nde entr√≥ pod√©s recrear digo te acompa√±a Guillermo nuestro periodista as√≠ por d√≥nde entr√≥ el delincuente por d√≥nde se fue reci√©n ve√≠amos las im√°genes entr√≥ por el fondo entr√≥ por el fondo por el port√≥n del fondo y lo empuj√≥ y se meti√≥ no tuvo que romper nada no no est√° el port√≥n ya tiene un pasador como se hab√≠a ido uno de los nuestros compa√±eros abri√≥ el corri√≥ el pasador y se meti√≥ va en realidad empuj√≥ el port√≥n como no estaba puesto el pasador se meti√≥ y pas√≥ y es lo √∫nico que falta la la bicicleta O vos en su salida notado que se lleva algo lo que pasa que claro nosotros notamos que en el buzo se lleva algo no s√© qu√© m√°s se lleva la parte de las herramientas estaba cerrado pero el parte del cami√≥n hicimos un recuento no falta nada Pero nada no sabemos si es que se llev√≥ algo Mart√≠n Cu√°nto hace que sos bombero yo 19 a√±os y medio hab√≠a pasado algo as√≠ ya hace un tiempo cuando ni bien salimos de la pandemia est√°bamos haciendo una refacci√≥n ac√° en el cuartel y se llevaron un rotopercutor del alba√±il que estaba tambi√©n adentro del cuartel Y qu√© cambia a partir de ahora porque claro el movimiento y la din√°mica de un cuartel de bomberos no les permite que pueda estar todo cerrado digo ustedes no pueden modificar demasiado la fisonom√≠a del lugar claro o sea ac√° La idea es no no modificar nada nuestro sino que esto no vuelva a suceder por parte de la gente no no es justo que a los servidores p√∫blicos no s√© si todo el mundo sabe o se da cuenta que esto es un cuartel de bomberos voluntarios Todo el personal que est√° ac√° no es rentado no cobran un sueldo Esa bicicleta se la compra con su propio trabajo y la utiliza para moverse pues no tiene auto no tiene moto tiene la bici y bueno nada se la llevaron y como a todos sabemos nos cuesta las cosas S√≠ justo lo hab√≠a terminado de pagar a principio de mes y bueno ahora vos sab√©s que que hoy cuando conoc√≠ la noticia alguien me dijo una cosa muy sensata la verdad que hay que buscar a ver si hay alguna bicicleter√≠a cerca porque por lo general lo que hacen es venderla r√°pidamente lo que le pedimos que no que nadie la compre no que no compren una bicicleta usada porque puede llegar a ser de uno de los bomberos de la zona exactamente o sea eso muchas veces hasta lo hablo con mis hermanos claro cuando hablamos se robaron tal cosa y dec√≠s Si la gente no comprar√≠a cosas robadas se cortar√≠a nada porque no tendr√≠a donde ubicarla claro se cortar√≠a el circuito de del robo no si la persona roba y alguien se la vende Porque alguien la compra si hay demanda sale a robar ten√©s esperanza de que aparezca la bicicleta o que alguien quiz√°s pueda colaborar para Claro que s√≠ yo creo que s√≠ porque no es una bicicleta normal com√∫n y corriente tiene un color o sea distinto a otras bicicletas tiene tiene un cuadro diferente a otras bicicletas y bueno nada esperemos que alguno la vea se d√© cuenta que es una bicicleta del bombero y la devuelva sin dudas Bueno contanos c√≥mo es para cerrar

crecen Ucrania no desiste y quiere ser parte de la otan pero lo lograr√° desde ya te adelantamos que en esta oportunidad no fue del todo amable con sus socios geoestrat√©gicos acomp√°√±anos en esta incre√≠ble historia y no cambies de canal hace tiempo que Ucrania insiste en su adhesi√≥n a la otan el pedido que se hace desde la actual gesti√≥n de gobierno no es novedosa sin embargo en los √∫ltimos meses puntualmente desde el estallido de la guerra es la demanda que tiene como objetivo integrar la alianza militar se potenci√≥ la afiliaci√≥n fue negada rotundamente en este marco y a pocos d√≠as del esperado encuentro de las autoridades occidentales en lituania el presidente bolo de mirt selenski ha enviado un duro mensaje a sus socios que dijo aqu√≠ respondemos eso y mucho m√°s los detalles a continuaci√≥n [M√∫sica] voz de la patria grande qu√© podr√≠a decir el presidente ucraniano bolodominski Para agitar a√∫n m√°s las aguas en un contexto determinado por el estricto financiamiento occidental el mandatario se anima a provocar a sus aliados c√≥mo te contamos todo lo ocurrido amigos de prensa alternativa del d√≠a 7 de julio vol√≥ dimmerce que brind√≥ una conferencia de prensa donde asegur√≥ que Ucrania podr√≠a no obtener la invitaci√≥n para ingresar en la otan debido a que algunos miembros le tienen miedo a Rusia en esa l√≠nea y a modo de ret√≥rica el mandatario se pregunt√≥ qu√© formulaci√≥n hace falta para una invitaci√≥n seguido a ello afirm√≥ puede haber dificultades en conseguir el apoyo Unido de todos los socios de la alianza algunos siguen Mirando a Mosc√∫ temiendo a Rusia aunque creo que es una gran oportunidad para mostrar el coraje y la fuerza de la alianza Es decir para el presidente algunos integrantes de la organizaci√≥n en la que √©l insiste en ser parte hace meses tienen temor de la federaci√≥n por el contrario √©l considera que su pa√≠s en este momento debe ser tenido en consideraci√≥n ya que necesita motivaci√≥n una se√±al clara y honestidad en sus relaciones con la alianza Esta no es la primera vez que brinda este tipo de declaraciones que pueden ser un tanto provocativas pero no queremos adelantarnos porque en primera instancia debemos detallar que estas expresiones tuvieron lugar en la conferencia conjunta con su hom√≥logo checop el se√±or Peter Pavel silencie en su deseo de conseguir suministros se encuentra en una nueva gira internacional Cabe destacar que Pavel es un militar de larga trayectoria que desde el mes de marzo lidera la Rep√∫blica Checa antes de ser presidente concretamente desde 2015 a 2018 se desempe√±√≥ como presidente del comit√© militar de la otan antes de ello trabaj√≥ como jefe del Estado Mayor general de las fuerzas armadas de su pa√≠s todas estas labores nos dan la Pauta de que se reuni√≥ con un gran Aliado adem√°s no podemos obviar que la ex Rep√∫blica sovi√©tica aboga abiertamente por una inmediata adhesi√≥n de que va al bloque militar de hecho debemos remarcar que en este viaje Ucrania consigui√≥ armamento como lo sabemos estamos enterados porque Selena adem√°s de reunirse con el presidente checo tambi√©n se encontr√≥ con el Primer Ministro petrefiala posterior a la reuni√≥n confiada en conjunto anunciaron que Rep√∫blica Checa donar√° a las tropas de kiev helic√≥pteros de ataque y munici√≥n de artiller√≠a Asimismo la gesti√≥n aliada contribuir√° al entrenamiento de pilotos ucranianos en el manejo de casa bombarderos f-16 si lo que est√°s viendo hasta este momento te resulta interesante Qu√©date hasta el final del video y no olvides compartir el contenido el presidente alborota da un nuevo paso y consigue m√°s suministros para sus tropas que sigue ahora el mandatario ucraniano adem√°s de tratar de Temerarios a sus compatriotas se mostr√≥ satisfecho con lo conseguido en ese sentido se justific√≥ no solo es dif√≠cil llevar a cabo la misi√≥n ofensiva sino que es muy dif√≠cil sostener un aparato de defensa Sin armas de largo alcance para √©l si est√°s defendiendo tu terreno y no puedes alcanzar la distancia adecuada para destruir a tu enemigo Entonces el enemigo tiene la ventaja de la distancia por todo ello Consider√≥ que esto es algo importante incluso no solo para las acciones ofensivas sino tambi√©n para las defensivas de sus militares posterior al evento el Primer Ministro checo record√≥ en su red oficial de Twitter que su pa√≠s es uno de los principales suministradores de ayuda militar a Ucrania Consecuentemente proveer√° de simuladores de vuelo para que los pilotos ucranianos puedan entrenarse en el manejo de los f-16 tambi√©n en suelo ucraniano el jefe de gesti√≥n subray√≥ que desde que estall√≥ el enfrentamiento a finales de febrero de 2022 Praga ha enviado a los ucranianos 4 millones de buses de artiller√≠a de Calibre medio y Pesado serenski lo sabe y agradeci√≥ p√∫blicamente el apoyo checo en estas circunstancias desde la visi√≥n del l√≠der de kiev sus socios son un gran respaldo no solo en lo material sino tambi√©n en lo moral y ello se debe a que Rep√∫blica Checa es una de las naciones que se ha mostrado dispuesta a recibir refugiados el mandatario ucraniano mencion√≥ esa cualidad y pidi√≥ unidad y coraje reconociendo en esa instancia que ser√° dif√≠cil en recibir un apoyo un√°nime a su deseo de integrarse estructuras euroatl√°nticas Entonces hasta aqu√≠ tenemos una visita a un pa√≠s Aliado un insulto p√∫blico a sus padres m√°s armamento para el ej√©rcito y un apoyo absoluto a queb ahora bien al inicio de este informe mencionamos que no es la primera vez que se lansky se√±ala en los medios que los integrantes de la otan tienen temor de Rusia insistimos no son estos mismos integrantes los que est√°n financiando la guerra la realidad es que s√≠ en t√©rminos generales y en t√©rminos de conveniencia no es un buen momento para catalogar despectivamente a sus pares pero tampoco lo fue hace un a√±o cuando entre otras cuestiones el mandatario declar√≥ p√∫blicamente que las enormes potencias aliadas tem√≠an a Mosc√∫ para selenski su negativa a pertenecer se deb√≠a estrictamente al miedo a qu√© nos referimos ya lo vas a conocer hablamos del mes de marzo de 2022 a pocos d√≠as del estallido ve√≠amos un presidente molesto Que declaraba en medios locales que ya hab√≠an comprendido que no eran aceptados en la otan porque sus estados miembros tienen miedo de Rusia En aquel momento el l√≠der de quiebre declar√≥ que hay pa√≠ses de la otan que quieren ser garantes de la seguridad de Ucrania que est√°n dispuestos a hacer todo lo que la alianza deber√≠a hacer si fueran miembros frente a ellos sentenci√≥ pienso que es un compromiso normal desde entonces elensky ha reforzado este discurso a m√°s de un a√±o de la movilizaci√≥n de las tropas el pol√≠tico no se conforma e incluso se avienta a dar ultim√°tums como el del mes de junio el d√≠a 29 Igor sopca el principal asesor diplom√°tico del presidente advirti√≥ que este no participar√° en la pr√≥xima cumbre de la otan si los pa√≠ses miembros no empiezan el proceso de adhesi√≥n de Ucrania a la alianza el representante entabl√≥ di√°logo con la agencia routers all√≠ avis√≥ que kiev durante la Cumbre de la organizaci√≥n que se celebrar√° los d√≠as 11 y 12 de julio en lituania quiere recibir una respuesta sobre su solicitud para afiliarse a la otan presentada el 30 de septiembre de 2022 textualmente sus palabras fueron esta solicitud est√° ahora sobre las mesas de los l√≠deres de los aliados de La otan la Cumbre de bina ser√≠a un muy buen comienzo para responder a esta solicitud y por responder nos referimos a la invitaci√≥n para la membres√≠a que es solo la primera etapa de acuerdo con subcap ya ha reconocido que no Puede unirse a la otan durante el enfrentamiento abierto con Mosc√∫ lo que estamos pidiendo es que se inicie el tr√°mite remarc√≥ m√°s que convencido el diplom√°tico posterior a ello general de la otan manifest√≥ que la organizaci√≥n no abordar√° la invitaci√≥n a quiebra a sus vidas en la Cumbre compa√±eros y compa√±eras del Canal la adhesi√≥n significar√≠a una escalada mucho mayor en la guerra recordemos que Rusia ha catalogado esta posibilidad desde el a√±o 2008 como una l√≠nea roja qu√© suceder√° entonces no lo sabemos pero aqu√≠ quedamos m√°s que atentos para averiguarlo y contarles todo mientras Usted qu√© opina al respecto soy el J Juan Jos√© del Castillo director del Canal

Doug Richards has the details. The Atlanta Streetcar
has had greater visibility than it
has had ridership, but putting it on the wildly popular Eastside, Beltline advocates say, could change tha. I like to bike sometimes.
I walk.
Ohh I love it because there&#39;s
a lot of energy in it. Few Atlanta amenities have the devoted following of the Atlanta Belt line. Walk and run and stroll, skatin, biking, walking, running. Yet the trail is incomplete without public transit. Running alongside the pedestrian walkway, say backers like Matthew Rao, I think it finally delivers a promise to many of te folks who moved there 10 or 15 s ago when this was promised. Bute fans of the Beltline aren&#39;t sold on that promise. I think it boils down to one thing, and that&#39;s space. If it&#39;s if it, if it becomes too congested. Is the public transit plan for the Beltline and extension of the streetcar that has run for 8 1/2 years with very few passengers. The existing streetcar line runs mostly on a loop through downto. The extension would take a North by Northeast route and connect with the Beltline at Irwin Stre. From there, the streetcar woulde five stops on a 1 1/2 mile streh along the Belt Lines East Side l before reaching Ponce de Leon A. They can arrive by
a scooter
on foot, on bicycle and they can
go home on Streetcar Michael. Brown says the new roue will connect 10s of thousands of new residents who have moved into trendy properties near the Beltline over the last decade. t it&#39;s also a tough sell
for some users. Beltline is sports, It&#39;s
music, it&#39;s fun, and I think derailed it will hu. Marta projects starting streetcr service on the Beltline in just four years at a cost currently projected at more than $200 mil, likely to be revised upward

Hi everyone. It&#39;s a terrific Thursday. We are literally going places today because we&#39;re starg off with some transit news. The city is bustling here in the ATL and the Beltline, Well that&#39;s no exception. Recently announced as part of te RAISE grant, which is an acrony, it stands for Rebuilding America&#39;s Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity. Well $25 million was awarded to the Atlanta Beltline, the largest federal grant in our cities history for transportati. Wow. The funds. Well, they&#39;re gonna be used for construction of 2.2 miles of the belt lines at Northeast Trails d connector trails between the Ar, Otley and Lindbergh areas. Also notable about this expansi, It&#39;s important to know that it&#39;s the first time the Beltline will connect to a Marta station. It will be connected at
the Lindbergh Center, and the goal is to knit togethee regional trail network along wih affordable housing options
and job centers. More access, more jobs, better transportation. That&#39;s the goal. We&#39;re
taking a step. To get there, very exciting new. Alright, Speaking of the Beltli, let&#39;s head on over to the West side of it to check out some, well, new events. You can run in a competitive
8K for ages 9 and older or join a less
competitive
5K race. That&#39;s me for ages 8 and older. And in that race you
can bring your dog. You can take your kids in the stroller July 15th, that&#39;s the date. But visit at Atlanta Beltline
on Instagram. There you can click on a link in their bio and you will see additional links to click on. There&#39;s a race series, there&#39;s bike tours in
the 5:00 and 8:00. Say like I just talked about, and it&#39;s all right there. Very easy to register. You can even raise the loop. Who&#39;s Who&#39;s gonna raise the loo? Anybody.

Peachtree is always a fight to the finish, and as Caitlin Ross shows us, for one duo hoping to cross the finish line this year, that struggle is worth every step. Traffic violation. Officer Melinda Lim isn&#39;t going to write Willie Hatchett a ticket. Make sure you get that. But their story spells out inspiration. She cares about the people, the relationship in the community. Willie met Officer Lim on the A JC Peachtree Rd. Race course last year, but he never saw her. And I heard so many great things about her, how she cared for me. He was just a mile into the race when he went down. I collapsed. Collapse mile into the race, Willie suffered cardiac arrest and Officer Lim was the first to respond. Everything was moving, everybody was running, and all of a sudden I see Willie just stop and he just collapsed. Doctors and nurses on the course rushed in to help. We just kept taking turns doing CPR because it was so high. It was so strenuous. After they got Willie into the ambulance, Officer Lim didn&#39;t see him again for months. I was worried about Willie. I I needed to know if he was OK. It was very concerning to me because he was down for so long. When Willie got out of the hospital, the two built a friendship step by step. Willie is a great father. He&#39;s a great friend. He&#39;s a great husband. I have heard nothing but great things about him. Those small steps adding up to a big idea. Officer Liam. Told me if you want to do it. I would do it with you. They plan to walk Peachtree together next week. Their friendship will endure long past the finish line. There&#39;ll be sometimes when I&#39;m having a hard day at work and I forget why I do what I do, and then I remember. I remember Willie. I remember you like you&#39;re one of the reasons why I do what I do. Reporting in Atlanta, Caitlin Ross, 11 Live News and thank goodness she was there. Saved willies life. Truly amazing that they&#39;ll be walking it together. And remember, it is OK to walk if you get overheated. If you don&#39;t feel OK, take a moment, take a breath and walk. Make sure you hydrate that day too. And don&#39;t forget you can hang out with us to watch the race and all of the fun that comes with it. The bands, the Donuts, Some people even drink some beer as they&#39;re running. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell. Our special coverage begins Tuesday, the 4th of July. Starting right here at 4:30 AM. I&#39;ll see you out there on the course happening now.

year, and more money could bring even
more visitors. The Beltline just got its bigget federal construction grant ever, $25 million money that will help complete the northeast portion of the trail connecting it to the Lindbergh Marta station. Yeah, this is a big deal. The economic impact of the compd parts of the Beltline is already in the billions of dollars. Eleven Alliance. John
Sherrick is
on that story for us tonight. He&#39;s one in a million. Actually one in 2,000,000. This beats traffic 100%. Daniel Treat one of the two million people who use Atlanta&#39;s Beltline every year. He says yes, he likes the sound of $25 milli. The huge federal grant
just announced to finish the northeast portionf the Belt Line all the way to the Lindbergh Marta transit station. The Beltline is Daniel Treats l. I stopped driving because of it, like opened up right into my backyard and I got this scooter so I could just hop on and. Go straight to town. It was a lot faster too. The new money in place
guarantees that the Beltline will extend
N from
ID 5, weaving a complicated two mile routes through the armor industl and commercial district, and then connecting with the Lindbergh Marta rail station, which will be the only
Marta station on the Beltline. Think about the original premise of the Beltlint it is there to give people optis and how they get around the cit. The Belt Lines president and CEO Clyde Higgs says the Beltline has already generated. $9 billion of private investment and development along the completed portions of its route, creating a regional impact inclg affordable housing.
And Higgs
says the new funding means that the entie Beltline around the city is nown course to be completed by 20-30. It&#39;s so like so much more
convenient
for me in Atlanta. John Sherick, 11, Alive news By the way, this is just the beginning. More changes could be coming
to the Beltline. In August, the City
Council will vote on a bill that would
block any
new Dr. throughs on parts of the belt. Line and of course those areas are very popular with the walkes and the joggers and the cyclist, and some City Council

fitness-inspired all around metro Atlanta wtih free yoga classes and group events on the BeltLine.,from the Bob Mills Weather Center Oklahoma weather expert Lacey Swope all right radar kind of lit back up again this morning that's right lace has been kind of been like that recently it's been like that it's been a little up and down we have those big time storms yesterday guys no tennis ball size hail we have some golf ball-sized hail possible over Durant and that's in one localized area not good for the town of Durant move right over you pushing to the southeast but in the Metro we've had a few pop-up showers that's about it our lucky star sky cam Network we are dry now some cloud cover overhead partly cloudy through the day taking back the past 24 hours take a look at the temperature Trend temps have not budged this is wild this is record shattering for this time of year that temperature Trend that broke a 120 year old record for yesterday our official high was 67 yesterday and just to put this into perspective for you this is how it can be in fact last year at this time guys excessive heat warnings heat indices were anywhere from 110 to 115. it gets nasty in June sometimes and I remember this well because I was about 999 months pregnant at that time this year completely different rain cooled air we've had about a half of an inch of rain in Oklahoma City we've had anywhere for from one to two inches down into South Central Oklahoma haven't had much up to the north and you're desperately needing rain exceptional drought still ongoing for folks in north central Oklahoma today the bulk of the rain will stay down to the southeast there's that severe storm that's moving right over Durant that's the only severe storm currently dry and OKC we've had a little rain over Norman a little rain over over Tecumseh now over Seminole little shower south of Rush Springs and the thunderstorm south of Comanche along Highway 70 could have a little hail in it Nickel Dime sized hail strongest storm just south of Durant it's weakened some in the last scan but heavy rain right over Lake Texoma another storm will be headed your way in the next hour or so hail detectors showing the storm that is moving over towards Hilton the hail Core is coming up some with that that may be pulse severe in the next hour but that's where the bulk of the rain will be very slight chance of rain in central Oklahoma and the risk for severe weather will stay to the South as well we'll be tracking it beautiful on our lucky star sky cam Network Downtown OKC 60 three their 50s in Western Oklahoma it's a little cool to start off the day today and in perspective of what it can be this is a very nice Tuesday underway winds are light we'll have enough cloud cover today helping to keep our temps again well below our average only 77 and I'm telling you it's going to be gorgeous partly cloudy Southeast winds 5 to 15 mostly dry into your afternoon a little hotter up to the north 80s on the way low 70s for highs in Western Oklahoma now future next gen shows a few showers around through midday then into the afternoon we're mostly dry let cloud cover off and on more sunshine to the Northeast and that's why your attempts will be hotter Now by this afternoon storms start to take off in the Panhandle and we'll also be tracking thunderstorms in Southeastern Oklahoma those could be severe wind and hail the concern and then that complex will make its way into Western Oklahoma late this evening as it's falling apart slight chance it makes it into Oklahoma City and then most of the night is quiet tomorrow mostly dry for your Wednesday with the chance of rain off to the east here's your storm chance coming up for this afternoon far Southeastern Oklahoma also in the Panhandle 60 chance that chance bumps up this evening and tonight in Western Oklahoma Strikers will be out they'll be bringing you updates on these storms if they are severe they'll be falling apart but up to golf ball size hail for a while and 65 mile per hour winds will be possible looking at the big view we've got the jet stream overhead helping to fuel those storms helping to cause them to move pretty quickly that system moves by another slight chance of rain and storms on Thursday we do have another system that Creeps in for your weekend so Saturday night into Sunday storms are possible especially in the north we'll be tracking that if they develop most of your weekends dry and we're back into a summer pattern you see that high that is what we call the heat dome in the summer that starts to set up squashes rain chances causes temperatures to heat up and that sucker creeps to the north next week and Parks itself for quite a while and we start to cook across Oklahoma

I partnered with Atlanta City Councilman, Michael Julian Bond for the Hello Fresh Grab & Go event at the Helene Mills Senior Center. We were able to distribute hundreds of healthy meal kits to the residents of District 4. This is what I call true ‚ù§Ô∏è Work!

Atlanta Beltline, Inc. hosted its Q2 Business Breakfast. This quarter‚Äôs meeting was centered around building and maintaining business resiliency. I was honored to have the opportunity to speak alongside business owners Kristen Sumpter (Red‚Äôs Beer Garden), Pouya Dianat (CreateATL), and Kat Taylor (Bankhead Coffee). 

I had the privilege of attending and cheering on graduates at the Atlanta Technical College‚Äôs 2023 Commencement üéì I am so proud of our graduates and I look forward to seeing great things from them very soon!

I was a special guest at the 2nd Annual Morning of Hope Breakfast, hosted by St. Vincent de Paul. It was a powerful, one-of-a-kind experience where I was able to hear beautiful stories about the power of Hope ‚ú®

I had such an amazing evening at the Emory University President‚Äôs Reception. I want to thank President Fenves for dedicating an evening to recognize and honor the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and the Atlanta City Council.

It&#39;s something police all over the country and Georgia use, including Gwinnett County
Police Special Victims unit manager
Lieutenant Jason Ayers and Sergeant Jennifer Ric, agreed to sit down with us and explain how they use it. Most of those cases are supposeo be reviewed by the manager or ae to actually make sure
that those they fall in line with what
the categories. In order to fall in line, police need probable cause, meaning enough evidence
to make an arrest, but can&#39;t for reasons
beyond their control. 11 Alive looked at the exceptioy cleared rape cases
for the department in 2021 and we found in many ofm the suspect was never questione. Can you have probable cause without even interviewing the suspect and getting the other s? All the parties and the witnesss need to be interviewed. If that&#39;s true, how are these cs exceptionally cleared? Technicay speaking, by statute you
have probable cause with the victim&#39;s outcry, but we were just talking
about that because we don&#39;t have that probable cau. I&#39;ll ask our legal advisor. We uncovered other discrepancies
in Gwinnett. One case, marked exceptionally
cleared, said it was because
the officer thought the rape allegation was fabrica. If that&#39;s the case, it should have been ruled unfou. What&#39;s the harm? Like, what are we getting at here? Is there harm in exceptionally clearing something that shouldnt be exceptionally cleared? No, no exceptional clearance experts say that&#39;s not true. Well, there&#39;s first, it&#39;s a disservice to victims. Secondly, it&#39;s a disservice to. The community. This is the polar opposite of keeping the community safe. Gwit County police gave US
25 exceptionally cleared cases to review. In most of them, they
were exceptionally cleared because they said the vm did not want to move forward. That is a legitimate reason, according to the FBI, but only if police have enough evidence to arrest the suspect. If that victim hadn&#39;t said that, they hadn&#39;t said I don&#39;t. Want to prosecute? I want to continue. Would there have been an arrest if there was evidence? But that&#39;s the whole point, is that&#39;s exceptional. Clearance is saying that has to be the Thresh truth. But you got to understand, let&#39;s pause it right here. We went back and forth debating exceptional clearance and how it should be used for roughly an h. Then our interview
took an unexpected turn when we started talking abt how police can arrest any suspet in order to establish evidence. And to establish that guideline of probable cause, you got to understand it&#39;s not just the victim&#39;s testimony. Police need probable cause
and then the deal. But we go beyond probable cause. But I guess I&#39;m curious then, should the police do that? Is that really you have to ask the District Attorney? But if you&#39;re the ones doing it, I&#39;m asking you why, why are you putting that extra threshold on yourselves? Because because that&#39;s
that&#39;s our moral duty, quite frankly. We can&#39;t just throw people in jail based on someone&#39;s accusation, regardless
of whether
or not the legal principal
says that&#39;s enough. Beyond a reasonable doubt is much harder to prove, and the responsibility of the District Attorney, not the poli. But by the end of our interview, Gwinnett investigators
were willing
to take a second look at the cases
we brought them. Exceptional clearance
is saying
you have everything you need
to make an arrest. There&#39;s just one thing
getting in
your way. And that&#39;s not what
we&#39;re saying here. Well, we can examine. I mean I can examine. That&#39;s practices, yeah, exceptional clearance, I mean cuz and to look at that. But I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re using it wrongly, but we can always take a look at it and just make sure.

So this comes as the Athens DA s under fire after a lawsuit clais she&#39;s making mistakes in court, leading to mistrials and
dismissed charges. 11 alive investigator Rebecca Lindstrom spoke with
a former District Attorney who shares his perspec. He said the Angel was as tall as the ceiling. Robert James is no stranger to the stress of being DA. Being District Attorney
is the hardest job I&#39;ve ever had, other than bg a parent of four children, becae all I&#39;ve heard and all you&#39;ve h. For the last two weeks is that I&#39;ve done nothing. James served as de Kalb County , leading the high profile prosecn of Hemmy Newman, a man convictef killing his alleged lover&#39;s husd outside their child&#39;s daycare. I want to go back to light my head with Rusty. It is a murder that gained natil attention. But before that job, James served as solicitor, beating out the incumbent for s. It felt like a hostile takeover. A lot of the people in the office were not happy. And it gives him perspective ont Deborah Gonzalez may
be experiencing now. We got a staff of 25 lawyers, 9 quit the first week and then probably about, you know, I don&#39;t know, maybe about another 10 or 11 quit after tha. So I spent my first year, year and a half just being an HR professional. I Deborah Gonzalez, when Gonzalez ran, she
beat 2 prosecutors already on the job.
Promising change, but your office hasn&#39;t bought in. People quit. Gonzales has had a tough
time keeping staff. She&#39;s budgeted for 17 prosecuto. We found since she took office, more than 34 attorneys have lef, Gonzales insists. The problem is pay, James says. If it wasn&#39;t a reason why people left in the 1st place, it is 1 . If I&#39;m working in an office, all right, in crisis, because let&#39;s call it what it i, it&#39;s in crisis. And if I can mae the same amount of money or even slightly less and go somewhere , more support staff, right, better investigators,
better training, then I&#39;m going to go there. So what does it take to finally break that churn time? Time is the only thing, but some of the community
say time
is up. Oconee County has 150
misdemeanor cases, DUI, battery and drugs, all at risk of being
dismissed because her office hasn&#39;t filed
charges in time. In Clark County, the problem is getting
cases to trial. Charges like aggravated
child molestation and sexual servitude are
getting dismissed. Even when a case gets to a jury, they&#39;re often procedural mistak. Gonzales never tried a criminal case until this year. And she lost her first
one that charge? Murder. According to a lawsuit now filed against Gonzales, she didn&#39;t know how to introduce vital evidence. If you have a good chief assistant, it doesn&#39;t matter as much, because your role, you know, can be primarily administrative. But if you don&#39;t have a good ch, if you don&#39;t have a good
chief assistant and you&#39;ve not been a prosecuto, it can be, it can be. It can be difficult. Yeah, because there&#39;s some thins that you&#39;re just not going to know when you&#39;re not going to know what you don&#39;t know. Very complicated situation there. Gonzalez did hold a listening session earlier this month. Robert James, who you
just heard from, says she should be doing
more of that. As for the lawsuit, tonight, a judge pushed the hearing on her case to May 8th.

Well, good afternoon
everybody. Let me first of all welcome you and thank you all for being her. And certainly just want
to thank the great legislative partners that we hae beside me and behind
me and appreciate Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones d Speaker John Burns for being he, as well as the appropriations
chairman, Blake Tillery from the Senate and Matt Hatchett. From the house and certainly want to congratulate Chairman Hatchett on his first budget. Lot of good work and I&#39;m just vy appreciative of both of their te and efforts that they&#39;ve made ag with the rest of the members ofe General Assembly from both chams and parties who voted
for the budget. Certainly glad to have the first lady with us today. Observing our activities to make sure we don&#39;t get out of line. I also want to thank OPB Directr Kelly Farr and his team for thed work and preparation for my prod budget that is now being put to work with these good folks behid us and a lot of their prioritie. So we&#39;re grateful for that. I signed the budget last Friday, the amended budget that was word on by all of these stakeholdersd these partners have been criticn getting this budget across
the finish line. Enabling us to make
strong investments in our classrooms, our workforc, public safety and much more. This mid year budget
includes a
lot of benefits for hard working Georg, but I&#39;m most thankful that thatt delivers on the promises I madet year to the people of
our great state. And it&#39;s geared to help them fit through 40 year high inflation. At the time, I said we couldn&#39;t fix everythig that Washington, DC had broken, but we will do what we can to hp Georgia families and businesses here in our state. And while some on the federal level are pushing a budget with raises on taxes of Americans, we&#39;re giving money back to the people through our budget becaue they know best how to use it. Last year, we returned over a billion dolls to the taxpayers of Georgia through a state income tax refu. This year, as you know, we are doing that again, giving $250 back to single file, $500.00 to those who filed join. And as I promised on my campaig, the FY budget I signed on or the amended budget I signed on Fridy will give nearly $1 billion baco Georgians for homeowner tax rel, saving them around $500.00 on their property tax bill. I&#39;m also proud that this budget includes $3.5 million in grants to increase nursing student capacity and grow this critical part of our healthcare workforc. And we&#39;ve also allocated $5,0000 to support paraprofessionals in becoming certified teachers, ensuring that we have more educators for our classrooms. And to ensure that our students and all those who teach and support them remain safe. This budget includes
over $115 million in school security grants that l be given to each school
in the state, $50,000 each to improve
their campus safety. These are just a few of
the items included in this budget and you&#39;ll hear from others mentioned today as well. But when you add them up and look at the budget as whole, it demonstrates some things I hope the Feds are mindful of during their own budget process. That you can hold the
line on spending, that you can use innovation to e government more efficient
and streamlined, and that you do not have to raise taxes on people to do tha. That&#39;s what the men and women he today have proven with this budt and I look forward to proving again with the FY20 24 budget. That continues to go through the legislative process. Georgia, as we say all the time, is the best state to live, work and raise a family. And it is because of the choices made in this budget by these grp of legislators that are here to. And I look forward to working with them to keep it that way. With that, I&#39;ll turn it over to our
Lieutenant governor, Burt Jones. I appreciate you. Appreciate it. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you Governor Kemp for that introduction and a good synopsif everything that we covered in t. Amended budget. I want to thank our
appropriations chair, Blake Tillery, and the House Appropriations chairs,
Matt Hatchett, and all your appropriations mem. All these subcommittee chairs oa job well done has been a pleasu, as I&#39;ve said many times before, working with both the House ande Governor&#39;s office on
this amended budget. I am proud that the hard work that we put into the great thing about having a $6 billion surpl, as we are allowed to fulfill
a lot of needs. But the bad part about it? Having a $6 billion surplus as everybody thinks their needs wil be met and we have to make the tough decisions in doing that. And but I think the, the governor has been spot on wh given a billion dollars back toe taxpaying citizens of the state, a promise he made on
the campaign trail, which we were glad to support ie Senate and I know the
House is as well. We&#39;re also excited about funding to mental health counselors, increased funding to mental heah counselors across the state. And adding funding to a new vets mental health facility facility in Hinesville, GA something that we were very proud of in the in the Senate and we&#39;ll continue to work on te the on the big budget. But I think All in all the amend budget was a big success and a t of it has to do with the coopern between all branches the House e Senate and the executive
branch which I said has been very
good and
and and it&#39;s been a been an honor to wo. With the speaker burns and Gover Kemp on on these budgetary item. So I will turn it over to the speaker and we&#39;ll take questions after the speaker&#39;s done speaki. Thank you, Lieutenant governor. Governor Kemp. How about daylight savings time? I&#39;m not there yet. I don&#39;t know about y&#39;all, but I&#39;m gonna get there. But good afternoon. It&#39;s great to be with
all of you
as we, mark, Governor Kemp, signing of our amended fiscal year 2023 budget. This budget is evidence of our continuing commitment
to making strategic investments while returning evey dollar of taxpayer
money that
we can. As much to be proud
in this document, I may repeat a couple of things, but they were they were
worth repeating, returning nearly 1 billion of taxpayer dollars funds through r home Homestead Tax relief grant. 26.7 million to provide a one time payment of $500.00 to to the state&#39;s ERS retirees. We&#39;re proud of that. $105 million for the Medical Coe of Georgia to implement a new electronic medical record syste. We&#39;re awfully proud of that. I want to come in, my dear friend and colleague, appropriations chairman
Matt Hatcher. Chairman Hatchett, his subcommittee chairs and all the members of this committee, as well as the House Budget and research staff for their
work on this budget. As well as Chairman Tillery. And his staff as their work, they&#39;re great work is appreciat. I also want to thank Governor K, Lieutenant Lieutenant Governor Jones and certainly against. A gentleman that it works really has worked really hard, but appropriations chair Tillery for their work and show working shoulder to shoulder with our group to make sure we seamlessly throughout this process. As our work continues on the fiscal year 2024 budget, we remain to be in good stewards of being and working together on this budget in a way that serves the needs of all Georgians. All Georgians. Thank you for being with us this afternoon and I&#39;ll turn it back over to Governor Kemp to take any questions you may have. I feel certain to speak or answr your questions too. I would. I would just say in closing, I just again want to
thank the speaker, Lieutenant Governor,
the appropriation chairs for for being here and again congratulations Chairman Hatchet on your first budget. Wt job well done everybody. Thank you all very much.

It is a new development in a years long 11 live investigation. In many cases customers tell us they&#39;re getting bills for water they did not use. It&#39;s unfair for residents to pay for water that&#39;s not use, and it&#39;s unjust to punish residents for the failures of the county. Neighbors are frustrated. They talked about it at a town hall. They talked about problems carrying over from high bills sent several years ago on 11 Alive investigation found people with bills as high as $19,000. Families tell us they don&#39;t trust the county process and to cab needs to stop cutting off water over unpaid bills until they sort out the issue. They just, you know, continue to try to dispute the bill. But at a certain point if the CFO says that that&#39;s the amount owed and that all checks out on their side, then they don&#39;t really have any kind of recourse. The good news is since the moratorium was lifted and notices and communication and even door knocks to residents that had outstanding bills, 94% of them have now entered into either a payment plan, paid their back bills or are soon to be caught up. So De Kalb says there&#39;s progress. There are people at the meeting say this has dragged on too long and the process is not consistent. They want more transparency from the county.

The first line of the Atlanta Streetcar system was implemented in 2015 and has been a terribly inefficient public transit program since its implementation. 

The numbers speak for themselves:

- The cost of the first 2.7 miles exceeded estimates at $99 million, or $36.7 million a mile, in 2015. In 2023, estimated costs ballooned to between $88 million to $107.5 million a mile for the proposed expansion with total project costs ranging from $176 million to $230 million.
- Even when it was free, ridership was significantly below capacity, and now that the line costs $1 a ride, ridership has sunk to an average of 400 riders a day in 2022. 
- The system has an average traveling speed of 5 mph. Considering the average human walking speed is 2.5 to 4 mph, it‚Äôs not unfair to say Atlanta‚Äôs streetcars are one of the slowest forms of public transportation available.

Rather than an expensive project that will serve a limited area and has limited demand by people living there, we should be looking at solutions that are a better fit for commuters of necessity, will actually reduce car usage within the city and be cost effective for taxpayers.

We haven't had the chance to do any since the pandemic and I'm so happy we were able to make it happen this year! 

I partnered with Atlanta BeltLine Partnership to bring Seniors a 3-hour tour of the Atlanta BeltLine Westside Trail. The event gave Fulton County Seniors an opportunity to see everything the Westside Trail has to offer. This fun, interactive, guided tour also taught Seniors how they can engage in BeltLine activities. 

Thank you to Michael Davis Atlanta BeltLine Partnership & Pittsburgh Yards for assisting with our 1st tour since 2019!

I moved here I'm a retired army I moved here when I came back well first thank you for your service I appreciate you why did you decide to come out and vote today oh I've been voting since I was a teenager so I believe in standing up for what's right in for my country and my community so I'm doing I was raised in Selma Alabama I was born there so voting is a big thing to us and my family so we take it very seriously talk to me about that well when I was growing up my mother wasn't able to vote in fact I think the first time she voted was when we moved to Atlanta in 68. so voting is uh it's just something we don't think about it it's as easy as getting up in the morning and doing anything else that's responsible like going to work a lot of people with especially with this runoff they're thinking Senate's already been decided control wise it doesn't matter it matters a whole lot you know if you were sincere the first time by voting and about your candidate you should be serious even more so now did you feel like it was a pretty quick turnaround from elections to runoff it is it is but you know I'm used to quick turnarounds so you're dealing with you no you do what you have to do thank you so much I appreciate it how long have you lived here I've lived here now for eight years I'm originally in Alabama in why did you decide to vote today I decided vote because of the importance and significance of voting once upon a time we as African-American we didn't have the right but there's so many that went on our ancestors that fought for the spirit gave their life for it so that's how important it is to me for me to pass the Legacy that they passed on when did he did get a chance to vote uh for my children my grandchildren and other people it is important for everybody no matter what nationality they are vote because somebody before you gave a very valuable life so that we could have this freedom to vote what do you say to the folks that say Senate control has already been decided it's just a runoff it doesn't matter let them know that that's true your one vote May uh prevent the candidate that you want to vote that you feel is appropriate for that job so your vote does count every vote count and I have trust in the system that they uh fairly uh scoring the voting then why did you decide to come out today as opposed to later in the week next week what I want to make sure that in fact if something happened in my health I would be here I'm not taking a chance I'm doing what I can do today instead of what I want to do tomorrow  ,no longer populated,,2022-11-22T22:54:34.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTFJBN3dNPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--42ea2d61254d72eb958a3959d60c4924799aa0bc/post-7167-78956760-thumbnail,3,0,,156,,

""The funding was intended to construct a trail connecting a residential and commercial complex known as ""Pittsburgh Yards"" with other portions of Atlanta's BeltLine. The developer of Pittsburgh Yards is Columbia Ventures, part of the Columbia group of companies that co-owns and operates a low-income housing complex with Warnock's church. ""The funding raises questions about whether Warnock's business relationship with Columbia had any bearing on his funding decision. Warnock did not respond to a request for comment. ""Warnock's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he serves as senior pastor and CEO, in 2005 'formed a partnership with Columbia Residential to rehabilitate [a] dilapidated high-rise' and turned the building into low-income apartments. Ebenezer and Columbia are co-owners of the business through a joint venture, with Ebenezer owning 99 percent and Columbia owning the remaining 1 percent, according to a state grant application filed by the entities in August. ""Last November, Warnock and Sen. Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.) announced that they had helped secure the funding for the trail project, which would 'construct approximately two miles of the Southside Trail component of the Atlanta BeltLine from Pittsburgh Yards to Boulevard Crossing Park.'"" ""Raphael Warnock is a corrupt hypocrite who only cares about himself, not the people of Georgia,"" said campaign spokesman Will Kiley. ""Warnock lines his pockets and the pockets of his allies while attempting to evict low-income tenants in the building he oversees. Since coming to office, Warnock has doubled his income while Georgia families struggle to make ends meet. Raphael Warnock needs to be held accountable by the 'media' and the people of Georgia for his lies.""", ,no longer populated,,2022-11-22T20:12:38.000Z,post data removed,,4,2,0,0,,

---Twenty-three years ago, Atlanta-native and architecture and urban planning student Ryan Gravel had an experience that opened his mind to what urban living could be.
""My senior year I spent abroad in Paris and lived without a car for a year and traveled by train everywhere,"" says Gravel. ""And within a month of arriving, I had lost 15 pounds. I was in the best shape of my life because I was walking everywhere, and the role of the physical city was made clear to me in a way it really had never been before.""
For his Georgia Tech master's thesis, Gravel sketched out a plan to make Atlanta more like Paris. He proposed redeveloping the land along the city's historic rail lines to create a 22-mile loop called the Atlanta BeltLine. He proposed turning the city's abandoned industrial areas and single-family home neighborhoods into business districts and walking trails. And he proposed connecting downtown to the rest of the city all with a new train running along the entire Atlanta BeltLine.
""I never imagined we would actually do it,"" says Gravel.
But they did‚Äîfor the most part. Cathy Woolard, who was president of the Atlanta City Council, read Gravel's thesis and decided to use it as a blueprint to remake much of the city. Today, the Atlanta BeltLine is a walking and biking trail, parts of which are bordered by retail and condos.
But one piece of Gravel's grand vision didn't get built: The train.
Today, Gravel runs a co-working and event space along the BeltLine, which also serves as a gathering place for urbanists interested in making Atlanta less dependent on cars. He says that the train line is essential for improving city life.
""In those early days, when we built the movement behind the [BeltLine] project, it was around transit,"" says Gravel.
The three COVID relief bills set aside $69 billion in federal funding for local transit agencies to operate and add to their transportation systems, meaning that Atlanta might finally get its train‚Äîwith many American taxpayers who will never step foot on it picking up much of the tab.
Many American cities have used federal money in the past to build rail transit lines that suffer from dismal ridership, that are expensive to maintain, and that are a major drain on their budgets.

movement behind the project it was around Transit the three coveted relief bills set aside 69 billion dollars in federal funding for local Transit agencies to operate and add to their transportation systems meaning that Atlanta might finally get its train with many American taxpayers who will never step foot on it picking up much of the tap many American cities have used Federal money to build rail Transit lines that suffer from dismal ridership that are expensive to maintain and that are a major drain on their budgets buses don't have the aesthetic appeal of trains and don't evoke the dense pre-automobile 19th century aesthetic that many urbanists romanticize but they're far less costly and more convenient and commuters generally prioritize modes of Transit that get them from point A to point B with the least amount of hassle the sharp decline in the number of workers showing up at an office every day post pandemic makes building commuter rail and even worse use of public funds says Baruch feigenbaum senior managing director of Transportation policy at recent Foundation the nonprofit that publishes reason TV and reason magazine you need a quality Transit Network that's absolutely true but it's the quality of the let work and not the actual mode that matters so there's been a major change that we've really not seen since pre-World War II days and that change is overwhelmingly negative for Transit especially rail Transit we're seeing rail ridership at about 40 percent maybe 50 percent of pre-candemic levels and bus ridership at 60 to 70 percent and I think most people would tell you if Transit ridership overall gets back to 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels that would be a wild success most people do not think that's going to happen 11 years ago feigenbaum wrote that the proposed Beltline train was possibly the worst Transit project of all time I think it's amazingly still true and the reason I say that is because it's very expensive and it doesn't connect people from point A to point B people don't go on Transit from one's house to another one's house and that's basically the only places that this rail line served and so there was no clear ridership for this train so they came up with these kind of East-West Sidelines that they said well you're right there's not any destinations on this belt line but we're going to build these other lines and then people are going to take them and so the two problems with that are one more expensive in order to build these lines and they had not identified funding for the first big circle not to mention these other two every time people have to make a connection or have to change lines you lose ridership a lot of politicians like rail because they say it's permanent and we can't change it and okay that's true but sometimes you want to change it gravel says that the emergence of restaurants and the thriving punt City Market along the Beltline demonstrates that when you build new infrastructure Commerce gravitates to it Ponce City Market is a major destination all these buildings being built across the way some of the best architecture in the city some of the coolest places to build some of the best companies to work for you know why that's there because about they're for other reasons but also we're building a future city and look at it proven by the last 22 years it's getting built in front of our eyes the best time to start Transit is 10 years ago the second best time is now Matthew Rau is the chair of Beltline rail now a group of activists pushing for the completion of gravel's vision because it's never getting less expensive we're talking about one-time investments in the life of a city and because they're more expensive means we need to go and figure out how to get more money but rail isn't really a one-time investment while Rao's Coalition wants the federal government to foot much of the bill for rail construction local taxpayers are usually responsible for the majority of operating costs for all forms of transit in 2020 transit fares for Light Rail and street cars covered about 14 percent of operating costs Nationwide getting federal dollars to build rail is kind of like being gifted a swimming pool that you barely use and then being left to cover the maintenance its costs it might have sounded like a good idea there is some local enthusiasm for The Rail Project Atlanta voters approved a half cent sales tax in 2016 that in part was supposed to fund the construction of the Beltline train but the city's Public Transit Agency known as Marta has been using that funding instead to improve current operations especially bus service the agency's most recent analysis projected that it would cost an estimated 287 million to 448 million dollars to build just the first three miles of track that's up from 172 million dollars which was the estimated cost just three years ago we're here in LA to look at bus rapid transit to see how we can transfer the best practices back to Atlanta Martin wants Atlanta to emulate the bus service in cities like Los Angeles that have dedicated bus lanes and synchronized stop lights to minimize traffic bus lanes cost far less to maintain than Rail and their routes are modified if demand Rises or Falls several studies have found that people who can't afford cars rely on buses more than trains and Marta recently abandoned A Light Rail Project in favor of bus Rapid Transit saying it would provide greater Mobility for far less money people rely on what they have and that's what we have there's nothing wrong with buses buses are the core of any City's mass transit system what we're talking about here is a different kind of project that is higher in capacity and creates also a beautiful place for everyone in the city to access Atlanta residents don't have to look far for an example of a streetcar like the one the Coalition wants to build on the Beltline they already have one that stretches 2.7 miles through the downtown area and this is what it looks like on a weekday afternoon at about 3 pm its average speed is about 5 miles per hour about the same speed as the horse-drawn Railways that crisscross cities including Atlanta in the 19th century the streetcar stops every quarter mile less than a thousand people ride the streetcar daily in a city 500 times that size it cost more than 52 million dollars per mile to build in 2013. the ridership on that is pretty low so it's dismal yeah so what what makes you think that this is going to be different I think the success of any Transit project is taking people from where they are to where they want to go or need to go it will be the first city and only city in the world to have this this multi-purpose Trail this Greenway and the transit within it and connecting to our existing heavy rail system even if ground broke tomorrow Marta estimates it could take five years to complete just the first mile and a half of track there's a good chance that Transit ridership will never fully come back post pandemic because so many fewer people are commuting to jobs even in New York City paid bus and Subway ridership is at 55 percent of its pre-pandemic levels Nationwide Transit ridership is at about 69 percent of what it was before covet rail Transit Nationwide has taken a particularly bad hit with ridership decreasing by almost 50 percent between 2011 and 2020 while non-rail Transit decreased by about 30 percent that Trend applies in Atlanta where Marta's bus ridership decreased by 39 percent post covid while rail decreased by about 62 percent before covid only five percent of Americans working days were spent at home researchers at Stanford analyzed poll data and concluded that now about half of Americans work at home at least once a week and about a quarter are fully remote the pandemic also accelerated the decade-long trend of Americans moving from cities to lower density suburbs including the area surrounding the city of Atlanta which saw population loss in its Urban core for the first time in a decade between 2020 and 2021 Rao says it's just a blip this Corridor which is half a mile wide will contain between 23 and 25 percent of the population of this whole city by mid-century and that kind of density will only work sustainably if we provide the Transit downtown Atlanta is booming you have more freedom if you can telework so people they go where they want to go I know that's surprising for a lot of people but people do want to be downtown they want to be on the Beltline they want to be here there's so much to do you can walk you can ride scooters you can ride your bike I walk the Beltline practically four times a week it's pretty integral in my life I like the skateboarding just have fun yeah and be drunk while Ponce City Market is a popular destination much of the loop is still a nature trail with nothing but single family homes around it gravel's Master thesis opens with a history of Atlanta Transportation pointing out that street cars were profitable in many American cities before they were displaced by roads and cars is that something that you think we can ever get back to where there could be an actual you know profitable street car um it's a good question um from my personal Viewpoint um I think it I think there's a shared good that comes with public investment in transit and so I'm fully supportive of public transit but like the military like highways like all kinds of things there are things that are good for all of us that we should be investing in collectively this wasn't always the case in the 19th century Urban transit systems were privately owned and operated companies would sometimes lose money at the fare box to encourage ridership but make it back by speculating in land that increased in value because of the new train station when local governments did build infrastructure they would sometimes pay for it by levying special assessments on land owners who benefited Rouse Coalition is proposing just such a special Levy along the Beltline but it would cover just 10 percent of the projected 2.5 billion dollar construction cost Federal taxpayers would foot 40 percent of the bill if the local stakeholders who stand to benefit from increased property values had to fit more of the bill maybe they would think twice while rail and city buses consistently lose money buses that move people between cities are still privately owned and operated at a profit Amtrak on the other hand loses close to a billion dollars annually and relies on federal subsidies the bill I'm about to sign along is proof that's despite the cynics Democrats and Republicans can come together and deliver results it makes the most significant investment in passenger rail in the past 50 years and in public transit ever feigenbaum says many politicians seem to care less about whether Transportation projects are best serving their constituents and much more about the spectacle if I'm a politician and I'm running for re-election I get to go to a ribbon cutting ceremony and say I did this and I get to send out a postcard to all of the voters in my district and say I did this I'm here working for you using your taxpayer money in dubious ways whereas if you're talking about operations there's no ribbon cuttings with operations it's not sexy it's not something you can sell saying oh your bus is coming every five minutes as opposed to every eight minutes gets a real yawn in a political type environment Atlanta's rail Advocates say that Marta's decision to allocate the money from the tax levy on improving bus operations defies the will of Voters what we're about is making sure there's transparency and accountability and what our public officials and public institutions are doing with the money that we're giving them to achieve an outcome and if there isn't enough money to build the projects that Marta said it could build for the money we said we would pay then I think it's up to agencies like Marta and our leaders at the city to tell us that and to give us the opportunity as to how to react to that there was a package of things the belt line was one of the things in the package and there were other things in that package including increased bus service and making sure that there was some better technology on The Rail lines we really don't know and I don't think they know why this passed and I should also note that there has to be some ability for a Transit Agency to make some types of minor changes when a major world-changing event like covid-19 happens you know Marta didn't know what that kova 19 was going to happen and they certainly could not have projected what changes were going to happen as a result of that the two coveted relief bills one signed by Trump the other by Biden sent 69 billion dollars in additional funding to America's Transit agencies at a time when ridership is falling this country for basically as long as you and I have been alive has been under investing in rail Pete bootage is of course running for president and so he's going to say things that a politician would if you spend more money on rail projects where they're not needed which is most places in the country you're going to be wasting your money I think if Pete bootage would go down a couple floors in the D.O.T building and talk to his Transit planners and it's folks that who have been there for more than five minutes he would realize that this doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense it means you're going to have fewer bus lines that you need because spending money on rail is inherently going to take money from bus it means you're going to have fewer transportation resources that you need probably roadways but could be other things such as bike lanes and sidewalks you're going to be spending funds that you just don't need in an economy that is already overheated Buddha judge has been a Critic of how cars reshaped the national landscape he said that the interstate highway system is systemically racist because it cut through historic black and immigrant neighborhoods if the highway was built for the purpose of dividing a white in the black neighborhood or if an underpass was constructed such that a bus carrying mostly black and Puerto Rican kids to a beach or they would have been in New York was was designed too low for it to pass by but that obviously reflects racism that went into those design choices you can question whether we should have built the highway system in the exact form that we did I think those are all fair questions but this idea that somehow we spent a lot of money on highways and so now it's time to spend a lot of money on Railways because that's just the right thing to do or that's just going to solve our problems magically it doesn't pencil out buses replaced rail not because of conspiracy but because they're much more flexible and cost effective Transit should cater to what customers want which fast and convenient point-to-point Mobility reimagining what Transit is which is it's not just an agency it's services that are provided to your customers which are people who are paying for and so we're not just talking about fixed Rail and bus we're talking about the Ubers and lifts we're talking about on-demand Transit we're talking about microtransit which is Transit that isn't travel on a fixed route it might go based on where it's needed we're talking about vanpool we're talking about sort of a concept of Mobility that might not in some cases involve people owning cars which is okay if they don't want to own a car and we have a system that works for them but I think that type of approach is going to be much better than forcing people to give up cars because we make it so difficult to drive paris's walkability is what first inspired Ryan gravel to reimagine the Atlanta cityscape in the late 90s today feigenbaum suggests looking to France for a different lesson about Mobility France which is not exactly known for being a free market capitalist Capital the private sector operates all

Atlanta (/√¶tÀàl√¶nt…ô/) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Georgia. With an estimated 2019 population of 506,811,[10] it is also the 37th most populous city in the United States. The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the Atlanta metropolitan area, home to more than six million people and the ninth-largest metropolitan area in the nation.[8] Atlanta is the seat of Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia. Portions of the city extend eastward into neighboring DeKalb County. The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and has the highest elevation among major cities east of the Mississippi River.[13]
Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad. With rapid expansion, however, it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The city's name derives from that of the Western and Atlantic Railroad's local depot, signifying the town's growing reputation as a transportation hub.[14] During the American Civil War, the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea. However, the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the ""New South"". During the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership.[15] During the modern era, Atlanta has attained international prominence as a major air transportation hub, with Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport being the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic since 1998.[16][17][18][19]
It ranks in the top twenty among world cities and 10th in the nation with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $385 billion.[20][21] Atlanta's economy is considered diverse, with dominant sectors that include aerospace, transportation, logistics, professional and business services, media operations, medical services, and information technology.[22] Atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and dense tree coverage, earning it the nickname of ""the city in a forest"".[23] Gentrification of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the 1996 Summer Olympics, has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline, altering the city's demographics, politics, aesthetic, and culture.[24][25][26]

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The eviction moratorium applies to federally sponsored and funded housing units and developments. These entities include the Atlanta Housing Authority, Atlanta Beltline Inc., Fulton County/City of Atlanta Land Bank Authority, Invest Atlanta, Partners for Home and the City of Atlanta‚Äôs Department of Grants and Community Development.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Bottoms has also extended an order that prevents the termination of water service due to non-payment through January 31.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Bottoms has also extended hazard pay for front-line City of Atlanta employees, which will continue on a month-by-month basis until a vaccine is available and/or the City of Atlanta has resumed operation of services in the physical workplace.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
A final order extends Bottoms‚Äô directive that the City of Atlanta refrains from imposing penalties on people or businesses who have unpaid taxes after April 1. That order will remain effective through January 31, 2021.

The installation features a short film by the same title displayed within a modified Ford Crown Victoria Interceptor.
Crown Victoria Interceptors are a popular vehicle used in police forces across the country. When decommissioned, they are repurposed and sold at auto auctions, often purchased by Black men in urban communities. The irony of the Crown Victoria being a popular car amongst Black men can‚Äôt be overstated, but the silhouette of the vehicle continues to have a visceral affect.

The project explores the notion of Black leisure by highlighting spaces where Black men can experience freedom, autonomy, and joy. Few representations of Black life depict these images or even considers these as valid experiences. We Can‚Äôt Cop‚Ä¶ uses cars as an allegorical as well as a literal suggestion of movement and escapism from the stresses and traumas of the world. From fear, to triumph, to joy and back to reality, the short film uses the aesthetics of magical realism to give viewers a momentary glimpse into the complex emotional landscape of Black male masculinity.‚Äù Written and Directed by Fahamu Pecou
