Chicago has had Light Rail (above ground subway) since the late 1800's, and Louisville still does not sadly!!! 

HISTORY OF THE L
Beginning in the 1870s, as Chicago grew at an incredibly rapid pace, private companies laid rail tracks downtown and began introducing streetcars pulled by horses. In the 1880s, these horse-drawn trolleys were replaced by cable car services. But this form of transportation couldn‚Äôt handle a high volume of passengers and it added to street congestion.

On June 6, 1892, the first elevated‚Äîor ‚ÄúL‚Äù‚Äîtrain ran from 39th (now Pershing Road) and State streets to Congress Parkway and Wabash Avenue. By 1893, the Chicago and South Side Rapid Transit Railroad extended this line to Jackson Park, the site of the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition of 1893. Today, this section of track is still part of the Green Line.

Multiple privately-operated train lines transported Chicagoans in the 1890s. However, these trains deposited people just outside the central business district‚Äîan area referred to as ‚Äúthe Loop‚Äù due to the cable cars that once created a loop around several blocks. A wealthy and controversial financier named Charles Tyson Yerkes soon changed all of this. Despite his sometimes illegal business practices, he had a lasting impact on Chicago by building elevated tracks above downtown streets to connect train lines together. Yerkes essentially created the Loop L we know today.

The first full circuit of the Loop was completed in 1897. Its steel structure was designed by bridge designer John Alexander Low Waddell. The iconic riveted steel-plate form resembles that of the Eiffel Tower (1889) and the original Ferris Wheel (1893).

All of Chicago‚Äôs trains were either elevated or at street grade until the 1940s. With funding from the Federal Works Agency‚Äîpart of President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal‚Äîthe State Street Subway, now part of the Red Line, opened in 1943. The Dearborn Street Subway, now part of the Blue Line, opened in 1951, following a construction delay during World War II. https://youtu.be/Sbq8uf25KWc?si=ssmwqb76ZzsmrSG5

The estimated cost to build the East End tunnels in Prospect, Kentucky was $338 million in 2014. The tunnels were part of the Kentucky approach to a new bridge. 
Explanation 
The tunnels were twin, two-lane tunnels that would carry traffic to and from the new bridge.
The tunnels were built under the Drumanard property, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
The tunnels were part of the Ohio River Bridges Project, which cost $242.34 million in total.

The Background Story

Plans for an East End bridge date back to at least 1969. Part of the problem with building it has long been that the Kentucky approach to this bridge would pass through the town Prospect, arguably the Louisville area‚Äôs most affluent and influential suburb. (For readers in Central Indiana, think ‚ÄúZionsville‚Äù or Southwest Clay Township in Carmel and you‚Äôll have the picture). The wealthy and influential residents there were long able to stymie progress on the East End bridge. They also had an ally in Louisville major Jerry Abramson, who greatly feared a beltway connection that would allow traffic to bypass downtown Louisville. He promoted a new downtown bridge instead.

In the grand tradition of political compromise, Indiana and Kentucky agreed to build both bridges. This was in part possible because of a city-county merger in Louisville, which reduced the fear of downtown lobby because they would still control revenues from any East End growth the bridge might spawn. Hence was born the fiction of ‚Äútwo bridges, one project‚Äù even though there is no real transportation necessity to link the two and either one has independent utility.

But the Prospect residents were never going to give up. As part of their plan to kill the East End bridge, they managed to get the Dumanard Estate put onto the National Register of Historic Places to make it much more difficult to route a roadway through it. After the original listing that included the home and gardens, the listing was later expanded to include the entire 55-acre grounds.

If you are wondering how building two bridges got to be $4.1 billion in the first place, this is an example of how. To avoid impacting this single historic property, Kentucky agreed to build a $261 million tunnel underneath the estate. (LEO Weekly discussed this in an article called ‚ÄúThe $260 Million Home.‚Äù)

The stunning thing about this tunnel is that the path of the road doesn‚Äôt actually affect any buildings, as this graphic from Broken Sidewalk illustrates:

If spending $260 million on this sounds ludicrous to you, then you are getting a sense of why Indiana shouldn‚Äôt be touching it with a ten foot pole.

A few readers were discussing Louisville‚Äôs old light rail proposal circa 2002 called Transportation Tomorrow (T2), so I decided to post the old renderings and route map in case anyone else needed a refresher.

From the project abstract at the U.S. DOT‚Äôs Context Sensitive Solutions site:

Travel and congestion in the South Central Corridor have dramatically increased due to population and employment growth within the Louisville Metropolitan Area (LMA). An important indicator of congestion has been growth in trips on I-65 that neither begin nor end in the LMA, but are ‚Äúthrough trips‚Äù on the interstate system. The combined travel on I-65 for local, regional and through trips has resulted in slower and less predictable travel times and reduced mobility for many interlocking travel markets in the South Central Corridor. Accessibility to jobs, business establishments, and cultural, entertainment, institutional and public service destinations is deteriorating and is considered a primary limiting factor to social and economic development. Neighborhoods are affected by the diversion of some longer trips to the local street system. Existing bus transit operates in mixed traffic and experiences the same congestion as a private automobile. In most circumstances, the rising congestion penalizes the transit traveler more so than the automobile traveler when both in-vehicle and out-of-vehicle travel times are taken into consideration. Existing transit, therefore, does not, and cannot, effectively compete with the single occupant vehicle (SOV).

But what has happened to the T2 light rail proposal since then? From TARC‚Äôs FAQ page: What happened to Light Rail?

The Light Rail project began with a Major Investment Study in 1996. After initial studies and analysis, rapid transit was prioritized over other alternatives and the locally preferred South Central Corridor was selected. The project entered into the Federal New Starts Program, and it was approved as a project in Horizon 2030, the region‚Äôs long-range transportation plan. The project then moved into Preliminary Engineering after the FTA issued a ‚Äòrecommended‚Äô rating and the draft environmental impact statement was completed. In 2004 ‚Äì 2006, the FTA implied that the movement into Final Design was not possible without a secured local match and the Draft Environmental Statement was not released for public review. At this point, TARC withdrew the Transportation Tomorrow project from New Starts program due to the inability to secure local funding.", ,no longer populated,"It's been a busy couple of weeks for Get On The Bus!!! ü§© First of all, don't miss our monthly campaign meeting NEXT Tuesday, February 11 at 7pm (Louisville Public Library Main Branch, Community Room 202, 301 York St.).

‚ÄúWhen I stepped onto that new train this morning, it felt like stepping into the future,‚Äù Greenwood said. ‚ÄúThese new railcars are an inspiration to everyone at MARTA and to our customers who will get to experience a cleaner and safer ride ‚Äì and hopefully one that shows them how transit can make their lives easier and their trip more enjoyable.

Passenger and small commercial vehicles pay $9 once per day that they enter the zone in peak hours (5 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends) and $2.25 in non-peak times. Motorcycles pay less and certain bigger trucks and buses pay more. Taxis get a discounted rate per trip.

So, would something like that work in Atlanta?

In a press release, MTA shared that the new pricing system made for 219,000 less vehicles in that congestion zone in the first week, compared to that week a year prior, meaning traffic volume was down 7.5%.

MTA has not yet been able to correlate higher ridership on buses and trains with the new tolls. For one, tens of thousands of people already use the system, which is far more reliable and dense than MARTA in Atlanta.

The $5 billion redevelopment between Mercedes-Benz Stadium and MARTA‚Äôs Five Points station is among the most challenging construction projects in the Southeast and involves the collective work of thousands.

The hotel and its sister apartment tower, called the Mitchell, are expected to open in 2025, becoming the first new buildings erected from the Gulch with several others under construction.

On Friday (January 3), Leroy Ramos was working his bus route for the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) when an argument ensued between him and a group of three juveniles. Police said the group refused to pay the bus fare of $2.50 and the argument escalated as one teen threatened to spit on Ramos and another pulled out a gun and shot the bus driver multiple times.‚Å†
‚Å†
Two juveniles were immediately arrested. The third, who is the suspected shooter, initially fled but turned himself into DeKalb County Police on Monday (January 6). The trio are facing murder charges.‚Å†

I am the project manager for Programs and Activations. We are a business and program district in Midtown, Atlanta and today I want to show you one of our big projects that we worked on with the Project for Public Spaces. So this space is a plaza that is right above a transit station in Atlanta and it's called Parva. It's like our subway station and before this was here there was just really nothing and we called it a plaza. It was like you want to empty and there's no furniture, no art and nobody really wanted to come do anything here. So we worked at PBS to do community engagement work and asked the surrounding community like what would bring them here? What do they want to do here? You know this is a space that is publicly accessible and we don't have a ton of public space in Midtown so we wanted to work with the community and make it a place where they wanted to come do things. So we got a lot of answers and we realized that a lot of people wanted live music, they wanted food and drinks, they wanted markets or sometimes so we realized we needed an infrastructure and support of it here. So I do what I'm going to put with it.",no longer populated,,2024-12-12T16:09:17.000Z,post data removed,,29,0,4,237,,

In honor of their 90th anniversary, Georgia‚Äôs Own generously donated $6,000, enabling us to create 90 warming kits to help those experiencing homelessness stay safe and warm this winter. These kits‚Äîfilled with essentials like blankets, hats, gloves, and more‚Äîwill go directly to outreach teams and emergency services to provide immediate relief to those living under bridges, in abandoned houses, or other unsafe conditions.

‚ÄúTroops on the ground are going out to places like MARTA stations, the airport, and underpasses to deliver these vital items so people can have comfort, food, and warmth,‚Äù said Hope Atlanta Chief Development Officer Kellie Glenn. For the past decade, Georgia‚Äôs Own volunteers have joined Hope Atlanta every month to serve those in need. Now, you can help too!

Remember to follow us @theurbanatlanta for all things development news!üëáüèΩ

A new 646 million dollar fleet of 56 modernized trains is set to debut in July 2025. Manufactured by Stadler Rail, the sleek CQ400 model features futuristic-looking four-car sets with open gangways for easier movement, and improved accessibility for bikes, strollers, and wheelchairs. 

MARTA also announced this week that it‚Äôs investing $500 million in a state-of-the-art train control system to improve safety, on-time performance, and efficiency. The new system will work seamlessly with the new trains, replacing the older 1970s cars. Testing is taking place in Salt Lake City, with the first trains scheduled for service in about half a year‚Äôs time. 

One cool aspect: the front of each vehicle will be lit with LED colors that correspond to each rail line. 

Ya‚Äôll excited for this?

One City‚Äôs Attempt to Change How Domestic Violence Is Tackled
San Antonio has long had a high rate of family violence. An unusual court is trying to intervene before the violence turns deadly.

By Edgar Sandoval
Reporting from San Antonio
New York Times
Dec. 3, 2024, 5:00 a.m. ET

On a sweltering July night, Jesse Falcon was so high on cocaine, marijuana and alcohol that he would later say that he barely remembered the explosion of violence that happened.

Convinced that his girlfriend was pursuing another man at a social gathering at their apartment complex in San Antonio, he began attacking the man. When his girlfriend tried to intervene, he shoved her so hard that she was left with a gash on her arm.

Mr. Falcon, 21, did recall one thing about the evening: ‚ÄúI was full of rage,‚Äù he said.

Cases like Mr. Falcon‚Äôs are troublingly familiar to court officials in San Antonio, which has long been plagued with a high rate of domestic violence. ‚ÄúThey leave jail angrier and more resentful, and the trauma continues,‚Äù said Rosie Speedlin Gonzalez, a family violence judge in the city.

A court run by Judge Gonzalez is trying a different approach: providing the abusers with a chance to change.

First-time offenders like Mr. Falcon can avoid becoming another statistic in the long string of men ‚Äî and a growing number of women ‚Äî who go to jail for hurting their families, if they are accepted into a family violence diversion program run by Judge Gonzalez‚Äôs court, which is known as Reflejo, Spanish for reflection.

The problem is hardly unique to San Antonio, a Latino-majority metropolis in South Texas. Much of the country saw a record spike in domestic violence cases during the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns, job losses and alcohol consumption drove people into tense situations indoors.

Many cities have tried to address the problem, and rates in several cities are declining once again. San Antonio is among the places that have assigned more detectives to domestic violence cases. It is also conducting ‚Äúlethality assessments,‚Äù in which officers ask a series of questions to determine whether a victim is in danger of serious violence or even death if an intervention does not occur.

But the city felt an urgency to do even more. San Antonio has consistently ranked among the top 20 large cities for rates of aggravated domestic violence ‚Äî higher than Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Atlanta, according to a survey by the Council of Criminal Justice that was released in October. San Antonio also stood out for having a large share of underreported incidents, said Alex Piquero, a professor of criminology at the University of Miami who was one of the study‚Äôs lead authors.

The new court is one of a handful across the country that provide incentives as well as accountability for perpetrators, aimed at helping them control violent impulses before they become deadly.
In exchange for seeing their charges expunged, offenders who appear in Judge Gonzalez‚Äôs court are required to complete an intensive program of frequent court appearances, counseling, treatment for addiction and random drug and alcohol testing.

On a recent afternoon, Mr. Falcon and a group of men who had all been arrested at one point for assaulting a romantic partner or a household member gathered in the judge‚Äôs chambers. Mr. Falcon soon found himself answering uncomfortable questions. A monitor he was required to wear had detected alcohol in his system, a violation of the program‚Äôs rules that could send him back to jail.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go a long way if you re-examine your steps,‚Äù Judge Gonzalez said, shooting him a stern look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre young. I want to see you do great things.‚Äù

This year, the nine family violence homicides in Bexar County, the unincorporated area around San Antonio, surpassed the number in each of the past three years, according to the county sheriff‚Äôs office. The city of San Antonio has also seen a troubling rise in domestic violence cases.

In 2019, the escalating number of cases prompted hundreds of people, many of them women, to descend on a town-hall meeting where they described chokings, beatings and other episodes of violence committed regularly, mostly by men in their families.

A judge ordered the creation of a commission on domestic violence to help address the problem.

Abusers tend to come from poor neighborhoods and often numb the memories of their own childhood traumas with substance abuse, said John Vacca, who runs a class known as Pathways to Healing, a requirement for those in Judge Gonzalez‚Äôs program.

Mr. Vacca, who served time in jail for gang-related offenses as a young man, today tries to help people recognize the triggers that lead them to violent outbursts. On a recent evening in a community center, Mr. Vacca welcomed several people who are part of the court‚Äôs program and made eye contact with Mr. Falcon, who sat in the front row, wearing a shy smile. Mr. Vacca wrote down two words on a chalkboard: Anger. Healing.

‚ÄúNobody teaches you about confusion ‚Äî it‚Äôs the beginning of anger, escalating to rage,‚Äù Mr. Vacca said as he paced in front of them. ‚ÄúOnce you feel that confusion coming up, that‚Äôs your warning signal.‚Äù
For Judge Gonzalez, who works closely with Mr. Vacca, the idea of a court like Reflejo seemed like common sense. Even before being elected as a judge in 2018, she said, she had grown frustrated while working as a lawyer and a social worker; there seemed to be a revolving door of people who were continually rearrested for assaulting a loved one.

‚ÄúMany reoffend, not knowing why,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt understand where these emotions are coming from.‚Äù
When she started pitching the idea of a program for abusers, not victims, she was met with resistance. One politician told her, ‚ÄúNobody wants to help a violent offender ‚Äî it‚Äôs bad politics,‚Äù Judge Gonzalez recalled.

Legislation to create the court, written with the help of the judge‚Äôs wife, Stacy Speedlin Gonzalez, a scholar who has been open about her own struggles with abuse and domestic violence, was sponsored by two local lawmakers and signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, in 2019. The court began in earnest a year later.

The court has since graduated 35 offenders, with only one of them being rearrested so far. Judge Gonzalez said she was aware of only two similar courts, one in Ohio and another in Florida.

It is hard to measure whether the program has worked where it matters most: inside families. Women who had a partner participating in the Reflejo court declined to be interviewed about it.

And not everyone agrees with its methods. Marta Pelaez, who runs Family Violence Prevention Services, an organization that runs a shelter and works to reduce family violence, said she found it hard to believe that an abuser could heal long-held, violent traits in a ‚Äúmatter of weeks.‚Äù Real change comes after years, if not a lifetime, of treatment, she said.

‚ÄúAnything that is close to 90 percent I‚Äôm very suspicious of,‚Äù Ms. Pelaez said, citing the court‚Äôs success rate. ‚ÄúIt is not possible to shift your attitude that dramatically. It would take years and years for a person to shift.‚Äù

Still, Mr. Falcon said he believed that without the Reflejo court, he would still be abusing drugs and making poor decisions. In the past year, he said, he has learned to regulate his emotions and follow rules. ‚ÄúAt the beginning it was hard to stay positive,‚Äù Mr. Falcon said. ‚ÄúBut I am glad I have stayed on track. I realized that they only want the best for us.‚Äù

He said the therapy had helped him think about the role his own family history played in his life. He was raised by a single mother who struggled to support the family with a job as a waitress. His father was in and out of prison. And he had faced relentless bullying at school, with classmates often making fun of his weight by mooing while he waited in line in the cafeteria, sometimes hitting him, he said.

Years later, he said, he found himself lashing out at the people he cared about, but had no idea how to seek help. ‚ÄúAs Hispanics, it is very difficult to talk about emotions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt seek therapy. It was very stigmatized.‚Äù

The other men in the program shared similar stories. Shawn Sullivan, 37, said he was 10 when he was forced to clean the area where his grandfather had just shot his step-grandfather in the head.
James Nicholson, 30, recalled that his mother, who struggled with mental illness and alcoholism, slapped him so hard when he was 4 years old that he lost several teeth.
They had paid it painfully forward: Mr. Sullivan said he was arrested after getting into a physical fight with a former boyfriend. Mr. Nicholson was arrested after striking his wife in what had begun as a petty fight.

At times, some of the people in the program falter.
Deonte Hawkins, 23, a friend of Mr. Falcon‚Äôs who is also enrolled in the program, was taken into custody recently after missing some of his required substance abuse meetings.

For that hearing, Judge Gonzalez had called in Mr. Hawkins‚Äôs wife to sit next to him. She sobbed uncontrollably as the judge tried to reason with him.
‚ÄúGive us some insight because we are at a loss,‚Äù the judge told Mr. Hawkins. ‚ÄúWe want to help you. Is that what you want, to hurt her like that? You love her, right?‚Äù

Mr. Hawkins lowered his head. His wife dried her tears and watched as court officers handcuffed him and took him away. Judge Gonzalez later said that Mr. Hawkins was doing better and had gotten back on track.

Walking out of court that day, Mr. Falcon said he did not want to find himself in his friend‚Äôs shoes. He said he had found a good job working as a barista at a coffee shop, and, while he was not thinking about starting a family anytime soon, he was not ruling it out for later. First, he said, he would have to do a little more growing.

‚ÄúMy attitude toward life has changed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI know how to respond to situations now. I‚Äôm a different person.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the things that Andrew Young brings to conversations is hope,‚Äù Franklin said Friday. ‚ÄúHe sees the upside. He sees the possibilities even in times of trouble.‚Äù

Atlanta‚Äôs transportation system may not have ever existed if it wasn‚Äôt for Young. The Former mayor was instrumental in rallying voters to pass a mass-transit referendum that only succeeded by a few hundred votes. While serving in Congress, Young helped channel millions in federal dollars to MARTA.

Dickens also questioned the cost of the project following a city audit and expressed concerns over the station being closed during the World Cup 2026 matches set for nearby Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Now, MARTA says one station entrance will remain open during construction, allowing for street-level and elevator access, as well as bus pick-up and drop-off.

Together, they hit the streets with a shared mission: connecting people experiencing homelessness with shelter, essential services, and Hope.

We are grateful to James for stepping off the field and into the heart of our community, showing that tackling homelessness requires all hands‚Äîon and off the field. His compassion, teamwork, and support inspire us all as we work toward a future where everyone has a place to call home.

Thank you, James, for your time and dedication, and to our MARTA Hope team for their tireless efforts every day.

There is also abundant paid parking in the vicinity, such as street parking on West Peachtree St, a surface lot next to the station, and the Element and Courtyard hotel parking lot.

‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you Cisco, MARTA, MARTA Artbound, and Ree de la Vega for helping make this event possible.

The high-rise, which is expected to open next year, is the first new tower erected as part of the $5 billion redevelopment of the Gulch, a 50-acre expanse of parking lots and rail lines between the Five Points MARTA Station and Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

In a statement to AJC, Centennial Yards Co. said it remains in compliance with its development agreement with the city and plans to add new affordable units at future towers.

She‚Äôs worked as the director of voter protection for the Democratic Party of Georgia and the Georgia director of voter protection for the Biden 2020 campaign. Here‚Äôs what she wants you to know:

- VOTE EARLY: Not only is early voting easier (more locations to vote and shorter lines), but it helps prevent chaos on Election Day itself. Many of the new regulations are designed to make voting take longer. On Election Day, expect long lines to vote.
- CHECK YOUR REGISTRATION: Over 100,000 voters have been removed from voter rolls. Check your status and register before tomorrow. 
- GET INVOLVED: Come to the State Election Board meeting on October 8th at 9:00am in room 341 at the Capitol in downtown Atlanta. Park in the Pete Hackney parking deck or take MARTA.
- LOCAL ELECTIONS MATTER: Local elections impact your daily life more than the presidency. Vote down the ballot.

#YourVoteMatters #votingRights #georgia #electionboard #georgiastateelectionboard #2024election"," Syra! Syra knows more about voting rights than anyone I know. She's gonna tell us how to fight back against the Georgia State election board. Well, ever since they got taken over in May by Maga, Trump, Loyalist, they have been doing the bet all they can to cause chaos in our elections. So one way that we can fight back, I think the most important way that everybody can fight back is go vote early and what does that have to do with the state election board? Well, they're trying to get us to the point. So if we bring our voters early before election day, before the lines, that is one way we can avoid chaos. So go vote early. Early voting starts October 15th here in Georgia, which is not this Tuesday, but next Tuesday. And then there's a state election board meaning on the 8th of October. So if you believe in democracy, if you believe in election rules, being non-partisan and helping voters and not being there to help a candidate, come to the state election board and make a public comment. So where do I do that? Like where is those these beatings held? Yes. So at the Georgia Capitol, I think it's room 341, but you'll find it. Come to the Georgia Capitol and it'll be all the people that will have lots of signs. Some are very proud of democracy. Some are less so. For you. Okay.

The legislation, which bars new data centers from being built near the BeltLine and within a half-mile of MARTA stations, is designed to prioritize human spaces over industrial use.

Atlanta's data center market has been one of the fastest-growing in the nation, driven by increased demand for digital infrastructure. However, city leaders are concerned that these developments could encroach on valuable urban space that is better used for public amenities.

The new restrictions will take effect once Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens signs them.

This allows the Public Private Partnership project to move forward, according to a release. 

In general, the project will add new express lanes in both directions along an approximately 16-mile section of Georgia 400 from the North Springs MARTA Station (Exit 5C) in Fulton County to approximately one mile north of McFarland Parkway (Exit 12) in Forsyth County. Like existing express lanes in the state, the new one will have variable-priced tolls that allow drivers to bypass congestion.

Take a look at one of last year's winners, a gorgeous development for students in Atlanta, Georgia.

When you can‚Äôt build out, build up. This thoughtfully considered tower rises 25 stories to take full advantage of its half-acre footprint within walking distance to Georgia Tech‚Äôs campus in the heart of Tech Square, Midtown Atlanta‚Äôs hub for startups and research centers.

Whistler offers 565 beds in 168 units and features more than 17,300 square feet of boutique-style amenities. Students can treat themselves to craft coffee and artisan pastries at the on-site Daydreamer cafe, exercise in the expansive fitness center with yoga and spin studios, or lounge poolside on the rooftop deck while enjoying panoramic skyline views.

The 284,839-square-foot property is served with one level of basement parking totaling 25 spaces to encourage a continued reliance on biking, walking, scooters and public transportation with proximity to Atlanta‚Äôs MARTA lines. The dynamic design of mid-gray tones starts with a stacked base of amenities to activate the street, and draws the eye up with slender, mini towers and rhythmically shifting balconies slightly offset from each other to create a dynamic facade instead of a static block.

Whistler accomplishes the city‚Äôs initiative to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment, while providing students unmatched amenity spaces and views of the city and campus.

Yes. When President Joe Biden and Donald Trump take the stage here at the midtown campus where CNN is currently located. Among other things, they will be trying to sweet talk voters who don&#39;t really think highly of either candidate. Leave it up to them. AO Feve says he hasn&#39;t seen enough of a difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump to make a voting choice between them. But when they debate Thursday, Feve says he could make a decision based on what he sees or hears. It&#39;s all in the air right now for me, whatever happen to me, if I see the debate change my mind. Ok, I&#39;m going that way. But I think that that would be an interesting debate. Ashley Lambert is a former Joe Biden supporter who says she thinks his past his prime. She&#39;ll be watching to see if he can change her impression. I feel like after he became president, maybe he wasn&#39;t necessarily in the peak of his years. We&#39;ve seen decline in regards to functioning. Although their supporters say there are huge ideological differences between Biden and Trump. Some undecided voters say they are more alike than they may seem to start. Both of them. Richard Brown says they both kind of disgust him. One of them, you can&#39;t trust anything. Uh, and the other one, I don&#39;t even know if he realizes he&#39;s the president right now. So, you know. Yeah, I have no idea. He&#39;s, uh, I&#39;d rather not have either one of them. Brown was among the people at the airport leaving town before the debate which Brown views as a great thing. We&#39;re going on vacation. I, I intend to not, I&#39;m not gonna think about either one of those people the whole time we&#39;re gone. You know what Doug, this is something that not just this gentleman is saying a lot of people are saying this. We do know that there are a couple of third party candidates out there. One of those RK junior pulled, I believe he got 8% in the AJ C poll. Are any of the people you talk to considering them. None of them, I did ask them about that and none of them said that they were, you know, it&#39;s easy to forget that a lot of people aren&#39;t really closely paying attention to a November election yet. And the likelihood is that some of those fringe candidates will get more consideration over the next four or six or however many months it is between now and November. It&#39;s a good point. Doug, thank you so much. Well, you can.

So this is the latest attempt to urge Marta to put a pause on renovation plans. 11 lives Britney Klein Peter joining us live from outside of that station right now. So Britney a big question here, what are their biggest concerns at the end of the day? They are just concerned about these riders getting to and from work and home and they say this temporary closure of the street access is just going to be far too long. This is a transportation for a lot of workers. I&#39;m disappointed but I hope they would keep it open after the renovations. I think it&#39;s essential. It&#39;s been talked about for a long time. I trust me. There&#39;s a lot of brilliant people at MTA and they all want to do a good job. And those advocates we spoke with earlier today, they say the under understand that the station needs those renovations, but they just want Marta to pause those plans and find some kind of resolution here. I did just hear from Marta in the last hour or so following today&#39;s protests and they shared with me that plans are still on track and they say any kind of pause would just disrupt this needed renovation reporting in downtown Atlanta, Britney, Klein Peter 11, a live news.

Yeah, I&#39;ll set mic check, mic check. Good. Ok, great. Hello everyone and welcome to the rally to keep five points, Marta station open. My name is Rebecca and I&#39;m the executive director at Propel A TL. I&#39;m a lifelong Marta rider. I grew up in the city and for me as a teenager, my parents allowing me to ride Marta by myself at 13 was a huge moment for me in my personal freedom and mobility. But today I&#39;m asking myself, why are we here? Why are we standing outside the hub of our system in an important city like Atlanta asking our transit operator to keep the central hub of our system open? We shouldn&#39;t be here today, but here we are because Marta thought that it would be just an inconvenience to close five points to pedestrians, to bus riders to add a significant additional delay for people with disabilities, making transfers inside the stations for somewhere between 1.5 to 4 years at this point. The timeline is so fuzzy. We really don&#39;t know what to think. What we do know is what we believe. We believe people should be able to access transportation options that make a basic level of mobility possible. Public transportation is not just about getting places, it&#39;s about the places we&#39;re getting to, we&#39;re getting to work, we&#39;re getting to day care, we&#39;re getting home to our families. It&#39;s a valuable and essential part of people&#39;s daily lives. I&#39;m speaking today on behalf of a coalition of 14 organizations who are deeply invested in public transportation. But as Marta Riders, we know that riding transit in Atlanta today already takes longer than driving for many trips. We do it anyway. However, this plan will lengthen those trip times even more for people who can afford that time. The least many writers work two jobs. I&#39;ve been there myself. You don&#39;t have an extra 20 minutes in your day when you&#39;re working two jobs, you can&#39;t just walk to another station, just wait for another train on frequencies that are between 10 minutes on a good day and 25 minutes on a weekend. When we hear this is just an inconvenience, that&#39;s just not true. There isn&#39;t just another hub, there isn&#39;t another station where you can transfer rail lines and dropping bus riders off at other stations mean they&#39;ll have to add an additional weight to what is often already a long trip. It&#39;s easy to say something is an inconvenience when you don&#39;t rely on it. So we&#39;re here today to call on Marta to do what they should have done in the first place. Keep the hub of our transit system open to the people who rely on it. Number one, fix the plan for people who rely on the elevators to transfer rail lines, people with disabilities, people in wheelchairs, people using walkers, people pushing strollers, people pushing heavy bikes. Number two, maintain pedestrian access throughout the construction project. Other cities do this. Atlanta is a great city. We have great transit service here. We believe Marta can do this. We understand it will be more complicated and more costly, but we believe the alternative will cost even more in the potential loss of riders and all those additional delays for 17,000 people every single day for 2 to 4 years. And number three maintain bus routes at five points. We&#39;re standing on Peachtree Street. Buses can be rerouted to Peachtree Street. We have four side street on the other side of the station, buses can be rerouted there as well and that will maintain continuity and some degree of convenience for the 17,000 people who rely on the Marta five point station to walk up, transfer from the bus to the rail or use the elevators to make transfers every single day. We ride Marta, we rely on Marta and we&#39;re calling on Marta to make a change to its plans. Thank you. Next up. I&#39;d like to bring Doug Shipman who is the Atlanta City Council president to give remarks. Rebecca first, let me say a word of thanks to all the organizations that have come together to really focus on this issue. Thank you to Deborah Scott and George stand up. You know, in 2021 when I was elected, mayor Dickens was elected and eight new council members were elected. I think that election brought together the most pro transit city leadership in a generation. It also brought together people who were consensus builders who wanted to work together. And you&#39;ve seen that over the last 2.5 years, council and the mayor on a whole host of issues have been able to work together. And we also have been about transparency and oversight over a year ago. Council member Dozier, who you&#39;ll hear from council member Faro council member Overstreet and myself started to ask fundamental questions, fundamental questions about how the more martyr dollars had been spent in the past, whether the city had gotten what we the taxpayers had paid for and there were not answers forthcoming. It wasn&#39;t clear how decisions had been made and it wasn&#39;t clear where those dollars have been spent. So we asked for an audit and eventually Marta agreed to that audit and the preliminary results of that audit raise fundamental questions. Fundamental questions about whether or not the more Marta program needs to be repaid for dollars that have been spent and whether or not the plans that we have are the right plans and can be funded. And over a week ago the mayor called for this project to be paused, not only because of the accessibility issues that Rebecca rightly pointed to which are completely unacceptable, but because we also need to know that the dollars that are being spent are going to be well spent because the vast majority of the $250 million slated to redo this station or more Marta dollars. So in essence, the biggest funder of the M Marta program, the only funder of the M MA program and the biggest funder of this project is asking the Mr A board to pause to make sure that we have the right plan. Now, some have said that we already knew about this plan, that we knew that the station was going to be closed, that we knew the scale of this. I have not found one person, one person who knew that the station would be closed up to four years. I have not found one person that had seen the Comprehensive Plan before the CEO of Marta came before the Transportation Committee at City Council a couple of weeks ago, this was new news and this new news has caused us to ask fundamental questions about this project and to ask for a pause so that we can work together this pro transit council and I would say this pro transit mayor want this to work, but we cannot make it work when we don&#39;t know how the dollars are going to be spent. And when we don&#39;t know what the plans fundamentally are and when our citizens are going to bear the burden of a closure that will make their lives worse. And so I am asking today that the MT A board follow the mayor&#39;s request as the biggest funder of this project. Take a pause, let the final audit come to fruition and let&#39;s together get a plan forward that will spend our money. Well, that will keep the station open and that will fundamentally improve the transit of this city. Because we have to be honest. Atlanta is lagging in its transit ridership since COVID behind most major American cities, we need more transit, not less, we need shorter headways, not more longer headways, we need more access, not less. This is a moment that we need better transit and plowing ahead with this ill conceived plan is the wrong direction. Thank you very much like you. Thank you council member, council president. Next, I&#39;d like to bring up um Atlanta City council member for District four, Jason Dozier. Thank you, Rebecca. Thank you to our partners and friends and family members and supporters who are here today. Thank you to council President, Shipman. Uh I&#39;m council member Jason Dozier, first and foremost, I just wanna say welcome to Atlanta City Council District four. Myself and Councilman Farro actually split the five points Marta station and both him and I have been locked up and wanting to make sure that we take a pause and take a step back and, and, and reimagine what five points ma station should be not only for our downtown community, but for the entire Atlanta region I came in do this work largely as a transit advocate before I was elected to Atlanta City Council. Uh I worked to bring two new bus routes in the Mechanicsville community. One of those buses you might see in just a few minutes, about 40 that connects Mechanicsville and West End all the way to midtown down Peachtree Street and five points, Marta Station has been such an important part of my life. Uh For, for about six years, I didn&#39;t have a car in this city. I would commute to Alpharetta. I would bike to the west uh west end Marta station, uh take the train to North Springs, catch the 143 bus all the way to the northernmost stop in the Marta system and then do the reverse in the afternoon. And I did that for six years. And so, uh in my role in the Atlanta City Council, I work to make sure that Marta and the city are aligned in ensuring that more people have access uh to the region and to our communities. And the only way we can make sure that happens is making sure that our stations are open to the people. One of the things I want y&#39;all to acknowledge whether your news media or your supporters. It&#39;s just the amount of people that are here walking, going to and from whether it&#39;s underground uh to the east of us are going to get something to eat or just waiting on their bus. The amount of foot traffic that you see behind us is indicative of the fact that five points MTA station is the busiest MTA station in terms of pedestrian entry and exits and closing this station for four years would have a radical negative impact on the success of the entire network. And so I echo the cname that was by council President Shipman. I echoed the sentiment that was shared by Rebecca C will propel a tl. We have to take a step back and we have to pause this effort to close down this station for four years. We can&#39;t let the World Cup decide uh or we can&#39;t base uh uh uh generational decisions on just the World Cup. We have to think about the Atlantis today who are using this system who rely on this system to get the work, to get to school, to get to the store, to get their kids from daycare. It&#39;s absolutely important that we think about the the regular people, the regular lanterns who live and breathe this system because they rely on it so much and so intimately. And so I just want to say thank you all for being out here today. The fact that we have so many supporters out here today on this hot June day is indicative of the fact that I think we are speaking with one collective voice. We have members of the business community, we have political community, we have activists, we have folks that have been in the church is doing this work for years, for decades. All speaking with one voice, Marta, take a pause, take a step back, think about the people, think about the writers and let&#39;s bring a product to the table that&#39;s going to support everyone and make it Atlanta for all. So thank you all so much for being here. And uh uh once again, welcome to Atlanta City Council Report. Thank you council member Doer. And as you can hear people walking by saying, keep five points open. You can see as, as council member Dozier mentioned the great level of interest. Next, I&#39;d like to bring up Central Atlanta Progress, President AJ Robinson. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to downtown Atlanta. Um We&#39;re grateful to see so many of you interested in this subject and uh we welcome you back any day. Uh I wanna thank our city council members, the mayor and all of our community partners who represented here today for joining us in opposing the current design of this station and the access. We are inspired by everybody&#39;s leadership and commitment to our downtown community. If done correctly, improvements to the station would be a great compliment to everything that&#39;s going the changes you&#39;re going to see in the core of our city over the next five years, which all aim to re establish the prominence and vitality of this five points area. But if we continue down the current design path, it will be a huge detriment to all who are working in this neighborhood. I want to repeat and emphasize a few points about the current plan. First, we shouldn&#39;t be using more marta funds for a leaky roof that has been neglected for 50 years. Thank you. Those, those funds should be ex be used for expansion and enhancement of the system. We deserve better, don&#39;t build, don&#39;t build and then open a $91 million B RT route which is going to come down MLK down there and simultaneously close the five point station, forcing riders to walk to Garnett for connecting trains. That doesn&#39;t make any sense. We deserve better. Don&#39;t pretend to ask for modification and thoughts on a new station plan for years and just ignore our comments. We deserve better. Don&#39;t claim the current plan does anything for riders or pedestrian accessibility? It will actually lead to less ridership. We deserve better. The amount of dollars proposed dollars should be spent way over $200 million to achieve roughly the same product is just plain wrong. We deserve better. And finally, why spend this kind of money when all of our other downtown stations also need immediate attention? We deserve better Thank you very much and thank you for your attention to this matter. Next, I&#39;d like to bring up Deborah Scott Ceo of Georgia, stand up and part of our coalition. Show me what? Hey, this is what community looks like. Tell me what community looks like. This is what community, tell me what black community, tell me what community look. Welcome. You tell me what this is black community. What for no, it looks like. This is what community looks like. This is what community looks like. Good afternoon. My name is Deborah Scott. I am the Ceo of Georgia. Stand up. I love, love this man. Wait, so wait. So let me just say we move this city. A tu moves this city. The people of Atlanta move this city. One of the things that I love when it uh when Andre Dickens says this is a group project. Well, look behind you. This is a group project. It&#39;s not gonna go down like this y&#39;all. This is Atlanta, the black and brown folks that ride Marta will not stand for this. You cannot close this Marta station. This is the epicenter of community. This is what community looks like. I&#39;m not gonna talk about the history of slave trading right up the street next to Marta. This is another uh insult to the community, to the disability community, to the black and brown community that pay their taxes to make sure the martyr gets them where they wanna go and if we&#39;re asking you to pause to get it right, then we need you to pause to get it right. Because this is what community looks like. This is what Atlanta looks like when you talk of about having a murder station open for the World Cup, but not having it open for the people. That&#39;s a problem. That&#39;s a problem. This is Atlanta, this is Atlanta. So what we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re gonna organize and we&#39;re gonna strategize, we&#39;re gonna organize and we&#39;re gonna strategize because this cannot happen in Atlanta in 2024. This is not the sixties as we celebrate the life of Reverend Fred Taylor who was known for his bullhorn. He&#39;s one of my leaders. I&#39;m committing to this campaign, Rebecca, I&#39;m committing to this campaign. I would like to be able to do something else during this time. But if we have to be out here, I wear the shirt that has Rosa Parks. She sat down so that we can stand up. She sat down so that we can ride trains and buses and we in 2024 are not gonna let it go down like this. So what we would call on our martyr representative is call the meeting, call the meeting. It&#39;s time to call, call the meeting, call the meeting. Because if we have to have protests here every day, we will, if we have to come to your board meeting every meeting, we will. But in the hot this summer, what we&#39;re saying is we want Marta to be responsible for the people that write it. And we&#39;re saying, no, it&#39;s not. Right. So wait, get it right. Have the meeting, compromise work with us. This is the way Atlanta gets business done. But there&#39;s another way we can get it done as well. Ok. There&#39;s another way because election years mean that we get to change our representatives, right? We get to set new policy, we get to help people to get in position or get out of position. And what we&#39;re saying is we stay united when you have the business leaders and the city council president and the council president and advocates standing together, you can&#39;t win. So what we want you to do is respect us, respect what we&#39;re telling you and saying that this plan is not right. We don&#39;t want the station shut down in the way in which it is. It is not right and we&#39;re not going anywhere. So this is what community looks like. Yeah. Thank you so much Deborah. Next up, I&#39;d like to invite Carin W who is a board member of Marta Army and propel A tl that, that two. Hello, my name is Cardin Wykoff. I am a disability advocate and Marty Rider and I believe that this plan to close five points for four years is discriminatory for the disability community. It is not right that in 2024 with the 34th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act starting and, and, and, and the annual celebration for the Americans with Disability Act is around the same time of this closure and we still have inequities. We did a test run what it would be like for me as a disabled person to use the shuttle service to transfer between center to Georgia State. It took 35 minutes, 35 minutes to go one way. Add on to additional time that I have to take. Not to mention the fact that that doesn&#39;t even include the backtracking. That doesn&#39;t include the additional time that it&#39;s going to take for me to get to my destination Marta, we rely on you. I rely on you, you take me to work, you take me home, you take me to the Atlanta United Games. You take me up to Cobb County to see my parents and my family. You take me places and closing five points is just awful. And today I&#39;m here representing the disability community because we believe that you can make this right by taking a pause and thinking about the disability community thinking about what it would be like if you were in my shoes. As Marty is the only mode of transportation for myself. Additionally, with this transformation, what it fails to include is a center platform elevator. We&#39;re spending hundreds of millions of dollars and we are not providing an additional basic entry access for me to improve transfers. I rely on the plaza level to transfer between different directions. It takes an additional 2 to 3 minutes than a standard able body person would be. And so not providing that center platform elevator also is another inequity to this plan. I believe with this transformation that we can come up with a better solution and to not close the plaza level. And I thank you for allowing us to speak today. Thank you so much. Pardon for those words. And now we&#39;d like to take questions. So I guess the basic question is, how do you think we got here AJ do you want to take the, how did we get here? How did we get here? That power? Well, I think that you have to go back to the more Marta tax was passed, it was passed in the wake of the failure of the regional transportation tax. Atlanta basically said we&#39;re willing to take on the burden ourselves in order to improve Marta within the city. A project list was developed. But over time, we have not seen shovels in the ground. We have not seen a lot of progress. We have seen money spent on the bus system, but we have fundamental questions which gets back to the audit about whether or not we actually got improvements and expansions to the bus system for those dollars that are spent. And then we basically got this plan after Council member Dozier and Council member Faro sent a letter a year ago with fundamental concerns over the bus access, the pedestrian access, the overall cost, the overall design. As AJ said, multiple members of the community have been giving input over the last year about concerns around this plan. And we got here because largely those concerns and critiques were ignored. A plan was developed without a lot of engagement and then it was announced a few weeks ago. And so we got here because we are not working together as zebra talked about in spite of the fact that we desperately want to. And so I think the process over years and over months is why we got here. Other questions. Question, yes. How does shutting down the center work with the gentrification that has been planned for a long time? That&#39;s a good question, Deborah, do you want to take that one? So I would say you were you here during the Olympics? What happened to our people? The public housing was dismantled and people were shipped out. So as the city transformed, we&#39;re leaving people out. This is one of the most unequal cities in the country, right? And so, but green is the equalizer, transportation nation is the equalizer. We need transportation to get all across this region so that you can stay here so that you can get a good job so that you can have decent food and decent education. So this is for you. Thank you. Thank you. OK. Have been the response from Marta with all of this um backlash all this time. Yeah, I&#39;ll take a stab at that and then let others answer as well. And so our coalition which includes 14 different organizations, including many nonprofits and a faith group. Labor union union organizers has met with Marta on a weekly basis since sending a letter to Mar A CEO call Greenwood calling for continuous pedestrian access during construction fix. The 88 inequities that are planned and maintain that access. We&#39;re in conversation. But what we&#39;re hearing is confusing and we&#39;re hearing Marta say we&#39;re willing to consider. However, we are still closing the station, July 29 to pedestrians and bus riders. We&#39;re willing to consider reopening after 18 months when that was always something that was discussed for the World Cup. So we&#39;re hearing a conversation, there is a conversation but we have not heard any concrete changes that we&#39;ve called for. Seems to be Dugger. Um My first question is, is 18 months. Ok. For inaccessibility for riders or is that still too long? What do you mean for 18 months? And then can you talk about the timetable of learning all of this? So when did you learn four years and then when did you learn? 18 years? Yeah, I answer your first question as far as um you know, is 18 months a appropriate. No, that&#39;s a short answer. Uh Having this station closed uh for any period of time that it doesn&#39;t have any pedestrian access. Uh I think that there&#39;s some stop gap solutions that we can explore. We saw what was done with the airport station where there was a four week closure and then there was some work done to accommodate pedestrian access while construction was ongoing. Uh But 18 months is too long. Four years is definitely too long. Uh Anything when we talk about over a year for closing, anything that&#39;s transformative for people&#39;s lives, uh negatively transformative for people&#39;s lives. So that&#39;s a non starter. Uh As far as when uh we first heard about that level of closure, I think House President Shipman alluded to this in his remarks. This is something we&#39;ve learned just in the last couple of weeks. I learned it through the ac uh and uh or not through the agency, I learned it during the city Council presentation, the agency covered in more detail after interviewing several members of the market team. Um And so, uh uh you know, when myself and council Faro uh raised the concerns that we raised starting last year and I know AJ and central line of progress have raised concerns in years prior as well. Uh You know, Marta was willing to meet with us and talk with us and tell us, you know, here&#39;s why we can&#39;t do this and here&#39;s what concerns we have with um uh uh uh uh uh making concessions in this way. Never did we talk about a four year closure every day. We talk about an 18 month closure. It was all about design design, design. One of the things that I&#39;ve shared with Marta consistently is the fact that the city is investing tens of million dollars in the two Peachtree Street right here. We&#39;re gonna bring about 600 housing units jobs, commercial uh You have redevelopment underground right next to us. You have south downtown redevelopment. We wanna make sure that people that we built spaces for people, that people and people can get here safely and securely and with dignity. And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve shared with Marta from the beginning. We never talked about closing anything for 18 months or four years. And so uh that&#39;s a very long answer to a very short question. But I think it&#39;s important that uh the people know that we&#39;ve been, we&#39;ve been bringing these concerns up to Marta for a very long time. This isn&#39;t the uh the first time Marta&#39;s heard from us that we want to see something different and see a change. But this is the first time we&#39;ve heard from them that we&#39;re planning on closing the station for as long as they are saying they&#39;re gonna close it. Thank you, sir. Other questions, decide not to go by the mayor or city council mayor to have a mayor to have an option to be able to. So the IG the Intergovernmental Agreement around more. Marta is specifically between the mayor and Marta. So that is the decision making apparatus. Counsel gets reports, but counsel is not a part of that actual agreement. I do not know. But there are obviously there&#39;s a question whether or not Martin needs permits in order to do this construction. That&#39;s a question as far as those permissions. There&#39;s also I think around future projects, right? So if Marta is unwilling to be a good partner here, then how do we rethink the process going forward for how we make decisions? And this is something that the mayor alluded to in his letter around the preliminary audit is that the auditors are raising questions about that IGA process and that perhaps that IGA process needs to be reformed. This is something that council has also talked about with Marta. Whether or not the Intergovernmental Agreement that is currently in place is the right agreement is effective, is allowing us to get to the best solutions. So I think I am very hopeful that the Marta board which has representatives from Atlanta, from Fulton, from dekalb will take a breath. We see that there&#39;s a better way forward and that the Marta board as the fiduciary body will step in and basically say yes, we&#39;re going to pause in order to make this right. Other questions also what Kerry talked about recently is kind of why Marta needs to act urgently. We haven&#39;t really heard a lot is that there are safety concerns with the roof and that, that they patched it up over time. But you know, that is why they&#39;re moving forward with this project. I don&#39;t know if any of you all can speak to. Are you all aware of legitimate safety concerns that would potentially be at risk if we delayed this, if, if, if this project were to be halted? Sure. One thing I&#39;d like to note is Marta has 25 points, construction projects, one is actively underway right now. It&#39;s a renovation project where they are making repairs. And as Marta riders, we know first hand, the station is in need of some repairs, it definitely leaks, it&#39;s wet days after a rain. So we know that repairs are needed. And as riders, we value the importance of repairing the hub of the system. Those safety concerns that you mentioned, what we&#39;ve heard from Marta is as they demolish the roof and take it apart, that that process itself will create safety concerns and issues. However, we have seen in other cities like Chicago when a roof covering a transit station is taken down as part of that process, they set up safety tunnels and walkways where pedestrians can safely walk. You see these in major cities all around the United States and the world. We don&#39;t see them as often in Atlanta. And I would say that we don&#39;t value that person walking the person riding the bus, the person riding transit as highly in Atlanta as we should, we should be able to maintain safe access under construction projects while it is complicated. So that is something that we&#39;ve heard about and discussed. But we feel that there are solutions to that issue. Next question, I&#39;d like to acknowledge Marta&#39;s Union president Brett Dunham, who&#39;s here as well. Thank you so much for being here. If you have any questions for him. Are there any other questions from the media? Sure. Um So I&#39;m gonna pull up um our web page so I don&#39;t miss anyone. Um And also on the front of the podium, you can see. Thank you, Deborah Loudspeaker. This one, I wanna make sure everyone here. So this is important, right? Thank you, Jason does her best to our left here. Um So I&#39;m here representing Propel A TL and we are part of a coalition of 14 organizations that include New Disabled South Disability Link, the Atlanta Downtown Neighborhood Association, Gogia Conservation Voters, Georgia, Santa. Thank you Marta Army, Georgia Sierra Club, Atlanta chapter thread A tl The Transformation Alliance Can Park Neighborhood organization immediately. We deserve transportation in downtown Atlanta. We deserve to have this center to be redeveloped right now. What this president of the council is doing is political grandstanding. He, I&#39;m going to continue to read the small nonprofits that came together today and to put together the coal. If you don&#39;t mind, he does not even use a carbon market Atlanta and strategy by city council member and many other r. So if you like to join me now shouting, let&#39;s start shouting. OK. It&#39;s all fine, open, open. So thank you all. That&#39;s the five boys open my boy out.

jam is gpb's music show it's a TV show and a podcast this is the third season of the podcast it just debuted last Friday and it I'm so excited to get to do this because I get to discover musicians and artists from all over the state bring them here to GPB and we record in our big TV studios we have down downstairs and it's it's so fun it's fun too because we get to discover along with you tell us who we should be discovering this season well the the the band that was first uh that just released last Friday is hey dreamer they're from Atlanta and they are so good always said there be days like this but I so that one's called blood on dirt wow starting hard charging Rock right out the gate I know right straightforward rock and roll from hay dreamer and what's interesting is Melody who's the lead singer of the band tells me about how she's working on her Masters in music business she has a undergrad from Berkeley School of Music and then is working on a masters from Berkeley School of Music she's very methodical with how she works her band it's very businesslike it's such an interesting conversation you can hear all of that on the podcast fascinating fascinating I understand also have pine box dwellers coming up this season they are from Way Cross Georgia and they play like swampy acoustic country rock it is so [Music] fun Something In The Water me so that's Something in the Water by hind boox dwellers you described them as swampy and that is correct yes right it sounds like South Georgia it really does so they are they're two guys and what it is is uh one of them is is older he's in his 40s and he's got this band with his buddy's kid and now his buddy's kid's in his 30s or something or 20s but it's this interesting dynamic between the two of them they're quiet they're reserved they're super nice but then when they play like they have so much personality in the music and it's it's so good all right who else is coming up this season Timothy Leon drove up from Camila Georgia now Peter do you know where Camila Georgia is I have no idea where that is south of Albany okay it's almost to Tallahassee Florida and he drove up to be a part of peach jam and we partied it was so [Music] fun and every think about you girl you know you're on my right I can help and I can live without you got to give what you day and night your love so that song is called you and uh you can feel the Baseline in your chest basically right right it is it he's so talented uh so Timothy Leon is a graduate of scad there in Savannah and so he's from Camila he's a preachers kid he tells me all about that but he's got this Poppy boppy Soulful pop music it was it was a lot of fun to have him in the studio you've also got Kyla Simone on on this season of peach jam which I think is pretty exciting she's got a jazzy sound to her she does so it's it's a little like R&B singer songwriter she's from Covington um she moved here from outside of DC to come down to the Atlanta area to be closer to our music scene and it's Unique but not different Lane through [Music] P going through gr that changed our [Music] lives CLS and [Music] F that's Kyla Simone being with you and I always love a song that you think you know what the next note's going to be and then they hit you with something different and better than what you expected that that that that's what that sounded like to me right in it so yeah it's it's very unique it's not strange it's not weird but it is very unique also she's a great um she's a great interview because as a woman of color she really encourages other women of color to play the guitar and she has a she tells me all about her foundation that she has doing that it's really fascinating and I love to talk to somebody who's passionate about something and to get to sit down and talk to her about that is just great so she's coming up later on in season 3 of peach jam and finally we've got uh the band run Katy run run Katie run is they're another party they are a lot of fun do did did just SP it out I you and I could it out but you know the Poli so that's St reliev by run Katy run uh they sound to me like if uh the band cooking on three burners got an excellent vocalist okay so what's interesting about them is to me it sounds like country rock they call it Roots Rock um she's very twangy she's very country sounding but they're from Buffalo New York oh okay and then came down to Atlanta in like 2012 but what I find very interesting and very brilliant about them is that they reach out to cities you know how cities have like first Friday concerts and they have these you know concerts free concerts they reach out to those cities because theyve built in crowds and they go and they play those and they play all over the state of Georgia they will build tours and go up back to Buffalo doing that playing those free shows and then you can also find them at Dollywood every year at their fall festival in Dollywood

And Liza, you&#39;ve gone beyond the turnstiles for a closer look here. Yes, indeed, because there was a lot of build up when the station stopped close down. Remember renovation started in April and here we are more than a month later and just in on schedule just on time, the station is now back open. You&#39;ll now see a much more bright airy feel as you go to and from Hartsfield, Jackson International Airport. Passengers telling us they think the renovations paid off the floors to the ceiling. The changes at the Marta Airport station immediately catch traveler Craig&#39;s attention. Everything looks shiny and new, smells good too. So it makes it even better as trains once again transport passengers to their travels or work they&#39;re met on the platform by a fresh new look following six weeks of hard work and renovations. A lot of people are saying, wow and immediately start to do the look around, which is kind of, which is great to be as a construction person because now they&#39;re looking around and noticing all the work that&#39;s being done between new lighting and amenities. Jermaine White, senior project manager for Marta, hopes the new aesthetics offer a better experience. Just the whole feel and look at the station is what I&#39;m most proud of. If you look upstairs, the moment you get off the train, it&#39;s a brighter feel. The texture of the services is much better. Uh The color wise, everything is just there. Passengers taking time as they pass through to share appreciation before heading to their next stop. It&#39;s amazing. I mean, I can&#39;t say it enough. I mean, I&#39;m gonna be excited to come great experience as always, but it&#39;s always good to have nice and shiny things, nice and shiny things. You got to love a little love for Marta, especially coming out of this anticipated renovation. And Mar a very strategically chose this time period this low between spring break and Memorial Day weekend to get this work done. Now, even though the station has reopened, the trains are running once again, the work behind the scenes continues with the full renovation expected to be complete more like 2026 in the spring. In the meantime, Marta is very much ready for the influx of passengers expected here at Hartsfield Jackson as we head into the holiday weekend, live at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. I&#39;m Lisa Lucas. Send it back to you.

The NFL releases the full schedule at eight o&#39;clock tonight. But we do know a few details. The Falcons have no international games this year and they will not be playing on Christmas Day. But let me tell you what, I do know, I can confirm the first three games of the schedule. The dirty burns will open at home against the Steelers. So yes, former head coach Arthur Smith returns to Mercedes been stadium to start the year and so far two primetime games, week two on the road on Monday night football against the Eagles. And for the first time in five years, the Falcons will be on Sunday night football in week three against the Kansas City Chiefs. We&#39;ll see if Taylor Swift will come to the A and of course, you can watch that game right here on our airwaves on 11 alive and tonight, one of the most anticipated nights of the off season for everybody. I think it&#39;s incredible that the release of the schedule generates the kind of excitement, you know, I&#39;m talking about. This is unbelievable. Like, what a privilege to play a sport where my high school friends are, like, refreshing their computer every second to try to see what the, the schedule is. I&#39;m like, I think I, I&#39;m in a good line of work if that&#39;s the demand for this sport.

When officers got there, they tried to render first aid to the victim but he ultimately died. Police said they are still searching for the suspect.

#11Alive #Marta #Atlanta #Shooting #Crime"," It was around 545 Thursday afternoon. Major Eugene Roberts says a 911 call came into Marta police. Dispatting us to the Omni-Dome for a person shot on the train. The blue line train heading eastbound from H.E. Holmes. In between H.E. Holmes and Omni-Dome incident happened. By the time officers got on scene witnesses were long gone, along with the shooter. It's unclear if cameras on the train caught the deadly shooting as for a motive. We don't know why it happened or the reasoning behind it. As far as security on Marta.

Now this happened during a really busy rush hour in the afternoon, right in downtown Atlanta MTA. Police got there to the Georgia World Congress Center station around 545. They responded to that shooting on the eastbound blue line train. By the time the officers got there, police say the witnesses were gone and so was the shooter. Police did perform CPR on the victim but the man died from those injuries at this hour. It&#39;s not clear if surveillance cameras caught this whole deadly shooting on camera at last check. Police are still investigating a motive. We did however talk to murder security, take a listen. We have train patrol on our trains, officers on the trains. But first and foremost, I wanna send out my condolences to the family. It is not clear if there was actually an officer patrolling that particular train when the shooting happened.

Look now at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport a pretty day to fly today. We are getting a behind the scenes, look at work to overhaul the airport. Marta station, the station has been closed for three weeks now impacting 11,000 travelers a day. All right, so 11 lives, Jerry Carnes takes us inside and has an update on the progress being made while it is a disruption. Marta passengers are getting used to taking vans and buses to the airport instead of training one day. Some of those passengers like Kenya Taylor and her crew prefer a ride in a roomy charter bus much quicker than I thought it was because originally I believe they said like 12 minutes between shuttles, it was fast, it was comfortable, it was clean and quiet. It is not quiet behind these doors in an area temporarily off limits to the public where work is in full swing to give the airport Marta station a major facelift. The rails that typically carry trains are covered by scaffolding. Crews are removing and replacing the tile where passengers typically walk it have that nice shiny coat to it that there&#39;s been significant progress in the downstairs area around the turnstiles upstairs on the train platform, work is a little slower. The tiles are a little bit heavier, larger tiles. Project manager Jermaine White says work is ahead of schedule. Despite that Marta will stick to their plan to keep the airport station closed for six weeks. Instead of opening early, we&#39;ll extend the amount of work that we can do to get things done, we can do within that six week window. We&#39;ll do that. There will still be major work to do before the end of next year to complete the facelift. Most of it will take place while the trains are running for now. While scaffolding sits on the tracks, there are vans and buses instead of trains, the cleanliness and comfortable chair, so very nice. And there are people like Kenya Taylor who don&#39;t mind one bit.

and and then there was a little bit of bubbling of excitement from across the transit World um how exciting are how excited are you for the future of transit in Atlanta announcing these four new INF stations yeah I'm super excited about the future of transit in Atlanta the ability for us to be connected more for people to be able to connect it to schools to be connected to work uh to groceries to Medical this is a way by adding four infield stations that are all strategically located on the Belt Line this will be the first time that Marta will actually be on the Belt Line so that individuals going to work going to school going to play can be able to get there on Rapid Transit and this will connect people across the city that unfortunately may have had a hard time getting to these locations adding to their work day by taking longer commutes but now they can get there better faster and uh with the knowledge that we're going to be coming soon with this from talking with those in the transit world after this announcement some said they loved seeing some leadership like there just had been a lack of top down leadership to Marta was that part of your reasoning in kind of announcing these and sort of taking ownership of this project moving forward yeah so we're working hand inand with Marta on this because this is going to be a a collective uh project working with martyr the Belt Line and the city uh this Administration likes to work together to get things done and so part of that leadership is asking for best Solutions asking for out of the box ideas how can we do more and how can we get it done in a reasonable amount of time and so that's why we went and uh heard from martyr and talked about some options and uh this is going to get done uh this is a proposal now that is moving forward and hopefully we can see some uh movement on it really soon some logistical questions when could we see it is there an order of these infill stations um when does construction start when could people ride these yeah so first stop is Murphy Crossing so we've announced that we're doing this huge development around Murphy Crossing which includes housing affordable housing uh you know uh rental units for retail Etc as well as this MARTA station and so we want to do a public private partnership there so where you know businesses can be there as well as the government uh providing this uh Transportation options so that will be uh one of the first Marquee stations that we're going to do and then going around the rest and so we want to get them all done in a reasonable amount of time they take some re what's reasonable I want to see some some activity uh between now and 2030 that's the Hope between 2030 who's paying for it where is this coming from will more Marta be able to fund all of this well some of it will be coming from more Mar but some of it will also be coming from uh work that we have by doing public private Partnerships so uh how Atlanta has done stations in the past is the past moving forward you can actually build a station that has all the amenities already in it from retail to dry cleaning to daycare to Apartments Etc so when you build it that way you're not just building rail you're also building a community at the same time and that's how you get the private sector involved so developers can help us with that last question on Marta you mentioned a lot about building out transit to the Belt Line yeah what about Transit on the Belt Line what does this say about the street car yeah so we are still looking at how to make sure that we can uh fully vet this process of getting Transportation around the belt line as well so we have to think is it going to be real is it going to be um autonomous vehicles like pods is it going to be uh bus Rapid Transit um people have this notion that we're talking about putting heavy rail around the belt line that's not the case we're talking about a nice slow moving people mover like you might see um at an amusement park or how you see in France and Italy and other places and in in Europe so we're looking at how much will that cost and how beneficial will it be to the public how fast you can get around what does it feel like and so these are things that are in engineering studies right now once we come out with that we'll make sure the public knows and we can make a clear decision on do we want it to be on Rails do we want it to be rubber tires do we want to be small pods or do we want to just leave this as a walking trail I think by having it as right now with these four infield stations you're seeing tremendous connectivity coming to the Belt Line and then now how do we get people around the Belt Line gotcha  ,no longer populated,,2024-04-16T17:23:29.000Z,post

Mayor Andre Dickens announced during his state of the city address, the new Marta infill stations will be at Krog Street, Joseph E Boone and Armor Yards. The newly signed administrative order also identifies a bus rapid transit route that will run from the redeveloped Bowen Holmes community to Ponce City market. Mayor Dickens has also announced a new heavy rail station at Murphy&#39;s Crossing that&#39;s in the Oakland City neighborhood. It&#39;s going to be the first to connect Marta rail to the belt line.

the title uh I guess there won't be a flu game for your king that's asking too much and we we we not going to spend a lot of time on this at all but I felt the need to address this so obviously LeBron James set out against Minnesota and Anthony Ed Edwards you know because he had that he had a little cold you know kind of similar to the Cod that him and dwade was making fun of Dirk nowinsky for but you know the the goat the self-proclaimed King the guy which whose Fanboys go to bat for him religiously uh defend his false Legacy with their lives uh Fanboys you will get no Flu Game to brag about from your king so yes the Lakers lost and you know surprise surprise uh but anyway moving hang on I want to talk about this whole thing uh this whole notion that Michael Jordan played in a watered down league and uh and that contributing to him being so dominant so uh from 1988 to 95 the NBA added six new teams that was the Miami he the magic the Charlotte Hornets the Timberwolves the Rapter and uh and The Grizzlies they added those six teams and because they added those six teams a lot of people try to use that against the legacy of Michael Jordan by saying that hey look he played in the water down the league the talent pool uh was diluted with these extra teams and there is some truth to that there there's some truth to that but what I want to say about that is this I don't believe that had any bearing on the Championships I don't believe that had any bearing on the Championships because if you look at it like this what I think that could have aided in is them having a better uh regular season record you know because they you'll get to play the weaker teams and there are more weaker teams to play in the regular season so I can see how that could have bolstered their regular season record and you know Fanboys if you didn't know uh five out of six championships Michael Jordan won 60 plus games during the regular season and five out of six of those 6 and0 no game seven six finals MVP championships that he has that your king knows nothing about um so yeah I can see it uh bolstering the regular season record but here's the thing by the time you get to the playoffs it doesn't matter how Dil looted the pool is it doesn't matter uh how many teams you have in the league if it expands to 50 by the time you get to the playoffs it is still the best eight teams from each conference uh to make it and so by the time you get to the playoffs you are still facing the best of the best and certainly by the time you get to the finals you still have the two best teams so regardless of what you were able to do in the regular season uh because maybe the talent pool was diluted and because um like I said because you probably got to play more of the Lesser teams uh by the time you get to the playoffs you're still facing off against the best to the best and you still get to to show your dominance uh and matter of fact I would argue that if it is indeed diluted then by the time you get to the and and if it's diluted so what happens is and we all know this in the '90s most teams had one Superstar you know and then The Supporting Cast most teams had one star standout and then in The Supporting Cast whether you're talking about Barkley and Phoenix whether you're talking about Reggie Miller and the Pacers uh whether you're talking about ying and the Knicks most teams had the one star standout and you know they might have had some really uh great role players or you know um possibly another Allstar but for the most part it was that Superstar's job to carry the team so I would argue that if the pool is indeed more diluted then that really makes it more of a superstar versus Superstar thing and that really is going to highlight not only which Superstars hone their skills to be the best which Superstars want it but which Superstars can actually lead their team cuz again you know MJ Barkley uh Reggie Miller Ying Elijah Juan for the majority of their careers some of some of these players changed in the latter parts of their years you know uh but for the majority of their careers you know they didn't have a big three like LeBron James you know they have other players who were capable of carrying as big as load as they were on the team with them you know it was the superstars and then it was everybody else so yeah so I would argue that the like I said if the pool was indeed diluted then that really made it more about the superstars and showing how the superstars could lead these lesser players to Victory uh but at the end of the day like I said you know by the time you reach the playoffs you're really dealing with the best of the best no matter what uh no matter how diluted the pool had become by the time you get to that point you've reached the best of the best and so this is like you know a lot of times when we talk about Bill russle you know and you know and people like to use the argument uh about the 11 championships when you try to talk about championships but we all know why we say Michael Jordan is the goat because he actually in in every C category he's the best of the best you know if you're talking about statistics and dominance and being the definitive Alpha on your team and championships and and all of those things together and even throwing influence in there all of those things together Michael Jordan has the best combination of all of those things that you can possibly get in one person but when people like to throw in Bill Russell thing with the 11 championships well most of the time they don't talk about that Bill Russell actually had a good team Bill Russ Russell actually had a good team you know that he led to those 11 championships and like I said because it was only a few it was a lot less teams back then that means from year to year there was a lot less chance of things changing so if you were in a good situation and you had good teammates and you had someone who was a great leader like Bill Russell and you could keep the foundation intact from year to year well then it was very likely that you had a high Championship shot each year because things weren't changing that much from year to year so again you know like I said I think the whole um argument about MJ playing in a water down League uh like I said the only way I can see that is affecting is is in the regular season you know like I said but because you probably wind up playing uh some of the Lesser there are more lesser teams to help boost your regular season record but but by the time you get to the playoffs it's all about you you've narrowed it down to who's the best in the league at that point so yeah I I don't think that's a very valid argument unless you're just simply arguing and like for instance maybe if you want to argue the 72 and 10 Bulls uh being the greatest team ever maybe there's an argument for that like I said because because of that regular season record and maybe you could bring in the uh the fact that the league was so-called watered down but but to try to diminish his championships with that that that's not a valid argument Fanboys let that one go that's not a valid argument but anyway we going to hold up here uh let let me know what you guys think in the comments do you think there's any validity to MJ playing in a watered down league and how that affect his legacy do you actually think uh that helped him win championships or do you think like I believe like I said I believe that if you believe it was watered down you know I feel like that something like that is kind of hard to quantify um but if you believe it was watered down do you believe that's something that's more going to affect the regular season like I said being able to stack up more wins in the regular season but like I said by the time you get to the playoffs and definitely the finals you are still facing the best of the best so no one can deny that part that means each year you know 91 92 93 MJ by the end of it he was facing the best of the best and he conquered that and when he came back 96 997 98 he did the same thing all over again anyway let me know what you guys think you all have a truly fantastic day and I'll see you next time all right  ,no longer populated,,2024-04-08T16:38:27.000Z,post data

watching in college football we've seen Monumental shifts with nil and the transfer portal but people still watching droves and it's only getting more popular we've seen the NFL add games change their playoff structure move teams and people are still nuts about it but if there are any existential threats to footballs over your overall popularity I believe they include these two things one taking political stances or denouncing patriotism the only thing people are more passionate about than their football team is their love for their country or their political affiliation we see it all the time we saw it with the Kaepernick situation taking knees during the national anthem this kind of showed a little bit of a [¬†__¬†] in the overall armor of football and there are people that are still now just coming back to the game because of it the second ex ential threat is changing the rules of the game so much that the game becomes unrecognizable football is a gladiator Sport and to be honest we love it because of the brutality and the physicality it's our strongest and fastest men running into each other at full speed the more we try to control the brutality of the collisions the more we are sacrificing to the overall essence of why we're attracted to the the game now we're seeing those changes with the new rules on how to tackle someone you can't really hit them anywhere and now you can't tackle them from the side or behind because you'll get accused of a hip drop tackle if you even whisper at a quarterback or blink at them twice before a Friday they send you straight to guantan Mo Bay now and yesterday they just announced a total overhaul to kickoffs now I get trying to be safer and there are ways through equipment to mitigate some risk but we don't need to sacrifice the physicality of the game for safety these guys know when you sign up to play what risks that come along with it it's one of the reasons they get paid so well we pay people more to do dangerous jobs just ask underwater welders are astronauts who we really just strap to a bomb to shoot to a place we don't know where anything is now these are the only two things that in my opinion can bring down what is by far and away America's present time and I hope we don't totally destroy our game in the name of quote unquote saving it we're bring in former quarterback David con former Michigan quarterback David con former Western State Colorado wide receiver blank Crane and David again I'm not saying we don't adjust as new equipment comes along where we can lessen the the blow to people's heads when they get hit hard but now with the new kickoff rule with all we're seeing with trying to mitigate every single risk we're going to shelter ourselves out of the sport I really believe that that's one of the two biggest threats of of a nuclear destruction well I'll be saying my piece on this uh on a certain segment a little bit later but like to steal your thought but like old school I really have nothing else to add that answer was blacked out I think everybody should be standing up applauding uh Jake crane right now for that answer but it really is true and it's not just happening in football this pursuit of safety is happening in all forms of life I think the book The codling of the American mind does a great job of breaking this down it's just extra weird to see in a sport that is the modern day Gladiator sport supposed to run that UFC right you would say those two true yeah but I mean it's it's like I I can't believe what I'm hearing when I hear things like you know lessening contact or you know limiting uh the contact that you have running down on kickoff it's just it really is kind of crazy to hear the the the big thing too is like I understand the NFL wants to open up to New Markets uh expand in Europe and Asia and get you know a billion more eyeballs on the I want CR company in Asia I would love that as well oh they love us in North Korea I'm learning Japanese so that I can be sh's new interpreter you're never going to so sorry yeah there's a good start uh you're never gonna out soccer soccer for the rest of the world you already have soccer so like look you can make it two-hand touch you can turn it into flag football the rest of the world has already falling in love with soccer keep what Americans love about football and and bl maybe we need to explain to people who don't know I know we have clips of the the new kickoff and stuff like that but isn't it ironic that we we this is just how as backwards we are right now I want everybody to just think about this for a second we're trying to take we're taking kickoff basically the collisions out of kickoff with the new rule for the name of safety right it's all about safety let's get safer let's protect everybody but there's some people that think dudes should play in women's sports man like the one girl the high school girl in volleball is like paralyzed on one side of her body but they're like no let let guys play in sports but let's be safe when guys are playing each other but when guys are playing girls that's even I want to walk down that road right now but you talk about player safety one can we start wearing knee pads and putting mouthpieces in and we're going to talk about player safety it's the thing of the past well first all I don't want to hear that that that ass excuse and two I've said what's going to happen I can see it down the line the robots it's going to be robot football sooner or later sooner or later all right the safety of players is going to get so to the extreme that players humans aren't going to play football all right humans will control robots who play football then the safety's out of well that be better you you can do whatever you can rip their arms off no but then the robots unionize and they sign a collective bargaining at that point they're being anyway but I watched an Amazon robot SE would people would people like if it was robots playing each other like if you had like every safety was the do you like Real Steel the movie yeah like but like you couldn't have the that human element is so important because like that's the storyline nobody's going to care about R2 D3 from Factory x R2 D3 like D3 football I I I think people like people will watch it regard if it's I think they'll watch it even more if if you're telling me if that thing from that NFL commercial NFL commercial I don't know which which one it is with that huge ass robot it comes on the show I know fox a fox all right you would watch 11 otimus primes have you detic on a Saturday at 2:30 have you guys ever seen a movie on CBS on CBS hey Autobot versus Des don't have a guest today we don't have a guest today the line's open at 7:15 a.m. Central right 8:15 a.m. eastern I want to know out there would you would you love let's say Auburn was playing Flor there'd be no recruiting no this isn't going down to college and the thing about it is you don't have to pay no I'm talking about across no that's what I'm saying they just congrats they just collectively bargained and the circuit court judge just said that they have out of the wall well then it just becomes about the player like all of a sudden like all the like sketch and all these other people are like the coaches at like full no like the co the the the fans like there's a league right now I can't remember some arena league where the fans call the plays of the game like sooner or later people will control the robot it's like it's gaming it'll turn into gaming I want I want I want to know Ready Player One people people be as jazzed up if they were robots playing on Saturdays and Sunday I'm talking about all across the board talking about college football and the NFL we want to know what you think 1855 236 3228 uh we're going to get to the chat too here in a second but David let's explain to people the rules real quick the the new kickoff rule yeah well just take a look yeah let's CU it would take the whole 90 minut so I'm trying to put my special team t on so basically they're just running a play they're just running a play that's what it is I always I always used to explain to our guys kickoff and kickoff return is nothing but an offensive and defensive play just from further away there's still a run fit sure it's a run play you have counters right you have boundary uh runs you know you have reverses things like that so basically the the kickoff team is now starting at the opposing 35 and the kickoff return team is starting at the 30 so it eliminates that drop and that full speed running down which to me there's a beauty right in in being able to let a guy run down and work the twists and things like that let's just run a clip of this if you're on audio that's the best way I can describe it this is from the XFL let's play it you can see it's just a run fit the ball's kicked depending on where the balls ball lands is whether you can return it or not and it's just just a play you're never going to return it there's not going to be touch if that's how kickoffs happened when football was invented none of us would have a problem with it again it's it's the constant changing of the rules and this pursuit of safety that you're just you're never going to get there you're never going to get there and unless it's robots playing each other yeah like unless you take people out of the game completely yeah and now with the hip drop tackle I mean you can't tackle people I'm supposed to now like try and Tackle Tyreek Hill or or these witches like I have to be just perfect in every single thing I do defensively it's just how about the big guys it's an impossibility how about the 6'5 tight ends like that's who you're trying to bring down at an angle yeah well again I'm just at at this point it's just trying to get anybody down is is a challenge so I mean I I don't know I feel like again this is one of the two existential threats we have for the game of football hey YouTube what's up hit that subscribe button we're closer to 100 trillion subscribers we're trying to get there before the end of April because

Riders who want to stay in the transit system&#39;s future have until the end of this week to apply for a pretty unique opportunity. Up to 30 people are needed to serve on the Riders Advisory council 11 Elias. Jerry Kearns is live outside the Lindbergh Marta Station to explain how this all works. Jerry Good morning, Ayesha Marta formed its first Writers Advisory Council in 2020 volunteers served for two years. So it&#39;s time to pick a new slate writer. Learn more about Marta. Marta, learns more about its writers, the blast of a horn, the squealing brakes of a Marta train. This is the soundtrack of Lavia Ley&#39;s commute to and from work, she&#39;s relied on public transportation since her move to Atlanta in 2008. Just to kind of clear my head in the morning before going to work. I listen to a lot of music. I read books and just I kind of zone out. Her mind is fully focused on Marta&#39;s, she&#39;s a member of the transit system&#39;s Writers Advisory Council where she shares her vision. I would like to see trans expand further within the East Corridor. Um I&#39;m in the Stonecrest area. Members of the ridership council are volunteers. Once a month, they get a behind the scenes, look at Marta operations and plans. They offer their experiences. They get to tell us about how we should run our bus service. How, what do they think of the new, the new train fleet that we&#39;re, we&#39;re going to have one of our earlier r members told us about a crosswalk at civic center station that&#39;s going to be under construction. Members of the council are encouraged to talk to neighbors about Marta projects and gather their thoughts on the future. It&#39;s about increasing the circle of influence that Marta provides. Lavia Ali&#39;s time on the advisory council is drawing to a close as Marta looks for a new group of volunteers be prepared to learn more about Marta, be prepared to meet fellow writers. Her voice is forever a part of Marta&#39;s soundtrack and Marta is looking for volunteers who not only use public transportation but are also active in the community. The deadline to apply is this Friday and Marta will announce finalists on April 24th back to you. All right, Jerry. Thank you.

They made these demands Wednesday. During the Atlanta City Council Transportation Committee meeting, they mentioned allegations of sexual harassment with one employee saying that they were accosted by a supervisor and those of others with similar experiences. An hr representative encouraged those victims to report the behavior. Workers also say they are concerned about pay. They want a return of $4 an hour that was taken away a couple of years ago, the airport did release statements in response saying that they do take these allegations seriously and will look into each and every concern as far as the pay. They say that a compensation study is currently underway.

Andrew Jackson Young (born 03/12/1932) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Daisy Fuller Young, a school teacher, and Andrew Jackson Young, Sr., a dentist. Young's father hired a professional boxer to teach Andrew and his brother how to fight, so they could defend themselves. Young graduated from Howard University and earned a divinity degree from Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1955. Young was appointed to serve as pastor of a church in Marion, Alabama. It was there in Marion that he met Jean Childs, who later became his wife. Young became interested in Gandhi's concept of non-violent resistance as a tactic for social change. He encouraged African-Americans to register to vote in Alabama, and sometimes faced death threats while doing so. It was at this time that he became a friend and ally of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1957, Young and Jean moved to New York City to accept a job with the Youth Division of the National Council of Churches. While in New York, Young regularly appeared on Look Up and Live, a weekly Sunday morning television program on CBS, produced by the National Council of Churches in an effort to reach out to secular youth. Young moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1961, and again worked on drives to register black voters. In 1960, he joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Young was jailed for his participation in civil rights demonstrations, both in Selma, Alabama, and in St. Augustine, Florida. Young played a key role in the events in Birmingham, Alabama, serving as a mediator between the white and black communities. In 1964, Young was named executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), becoming, in that capacity, one of King's principal lieutenants. As a colleague and friend of Martin Luther King Jr., he was a strategist and negotiator during the Civil Rights Campaigns in Birmingham (1963), St. Augustine (1964), Selma (1965), and Atlanta (1966) that resulted in the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. He was with King in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated in 1968. In 1970, Andrew Young ran as a Democrat for Congress from Georgia, but was unsuccessful. After his defeat, Rev. Fred C. Bennette, Jr., introduced him to Murray M. Silver, an Atlanta attorney, who served as his campaign finance chairman. Young ran again in 1972 and won. He later was re-elected in 1974 and in 1976. During his four-plus years in Congress, he was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and was involved in several debates regarding foreign relations, including the decision to stop supporting the Portuguese attempts to hold on to their colonies in southern Africa. Young also sat on the powerful Rules Committee and the Banking and Urban Development Committee. Young opposed the Vietnam War, [4] helped enact legislation that established the U.S. Institute for Peace, established the Chattahoochee River National Park and negotiated federal funds for MARTA and the Atlanta Highways. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Young to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Young resigned from Congress, and his seat was taken by Wyche Fowler after a special election. Although the US and the UN enacted an arms embargo against South Africa, as President Carter‚Äôs UN ambassador, Andrew Young vetoed economic sanctions. Young caused controversy when, during a July 1978 interview with French newspaper Le Matin de Paris, while discussing the Soviet Union and its treatment of political dissidents, he said, ""We still have hundreds of people that I would categorize as political prisoners in our prisons,"" in reference to jailed civil-rights and anti-war protestors. In response, U.S. Representative Larry McDonald (D-GA) sponsored a resolution to impeach Young, but the measure failed 293 to 82. Carter referred to it in a press conference as an ""unfortunate statement"". In 1979, Young played a leading role in advancing a settlement in Rhodesia with Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo, who had been two of the military leaders in the Rhodesian Bush War, which had ended in 1979. The settlement paved the way for Mugabe to take power as Prime Minister of the newly-formed Republic of Zimbabwe. There had been a general election in 1979, bringing Bishop Abel Muzorewa to power as leader of the United African National Council leading to the short-lived country of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. Young refused to accept the election's results, and described the election as ""neofascist"", a sentiment echoed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 445 and 448. The situation was resolved the next year with the Lancaster House Agreement and the establishment of Zimbabwe. Young's favoring of Mugabe and Nkomo over Muzorewa and his predecessor and ally, Ian Smith, was, and remains, controversial.

we are still here all right this is Vin Halen fair warning album review track by track uh centers swing all right look yeah I know I got the slurri but before I get into the music um I've noticed majority of my returning viewers haven't subscribed to the channel if you do enjoy this content please hit that subscribe button it does help us out and of course y'all know I appreciate y'all look I'm ready man fair warning so far uh two for two um actually Vin Halen hardly missed like hardly missed um it's interesting whenever I ask like what's your favorite track from these albums just to see the uh different type of people and the different type of tracks that they're choosing uh it's always interesting to me some would be like well this is my favorite off the album some would be like this is my least favorite uh it's it's always dope but let's let's get into it let's go ahead and [Music] listen woo all right you centers [Music] swing danger in the rear view Mir there's trouble in the Wind at that's bringing up the rear the menaces through SK she looks so [¬†__¬†] good so sexy and so frail something got the bite on me I'm going straight to hell and now we wasting time now wasted time more make up more make up L and you [Music] keep I'll come back to your senses baby we can't come to t i almost chased it in Bur he be simp pretty but try to take the F wearing out my welcome yes I better sa my praise now we're wasted time now we're Wasted timeck up say more pick up L you keep trying you keep trying [Music] [Music] I [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] soon you'll see my Silhouette darking in your door I can almost said I want all no one's suspicion no one's got it wi I make my fingers want my iron in that fire and now wasted time now we're Wasted Time same pick up L same more pick up line and you keep trying bu you keep [Music] [Music] trying [Music] yo yo I might be evil every time I hear every time I hear uh uh every time I hear um rth um every time I hear David Lee rth just saying rth just sounds awkward right I was about to say David Lee down like let me just say the last thing anyways every time I hear um Mr rth a cuss I chuckle a little bit cuz I'm just like you don't really hear um a lot of cussing like you know in rock and roll um music as much as they were so witty with cuz a lot of that stuff they wanted it to be played on the radio right so they they're really witty with with the way they say their things V Halen apparently didn't give a [¬†__¬†] and I like that if y'all know me if y'all know me y y'all know you know uh my language is a little bit on the Rough Side look I love the swing of this I no pun intended I love the swing of this um and I think this this song challenged the drummer right the speed the was amazing but yet it still had like a lot of wit to it um a lot of a lot of Rhythm [¬†__¬†] Eddie losing his [¬†__¬†] mind in there and the Charisma of Mr rth is just it's just impeccable it's just really impeccable and I feel like uh songs like this from V Halen these are Timeless songs man like this is there's not a time that when you listen to this you're not going to think oh this [¬†__¬†] is [¬†__¬†] fun this [¬†__¬†] is fun and that's what I'm getting from this album right last album was fun too like but all of these albums I feel like they're elements right this album do sound very very very fun like they were having a great old [¬†__¬†] time and what I love about Vin Halen is they try something new with every song right but of course once you hear that that that guitar you know what what um Eddie Van Halen's guitar sounds like it sounds like somebody with a pen just going just just just with a pin you feel me control chaos amazing that was fire so far um 3 for three three for three man we going to go four for four um like I said I'm going go back to all these albums I'm going listen to them again so I could you know your first listen to something you know first listen videos are very overrated but I know people love to see people um listen to things for the first time uh usually I have my best takes on a song after I've heard it like three or four times but I still enjoy doing these because the first time is you know you you can't beat the first time if you know what I mean y'all let me know how you feel about it in the comment section below of course I'm going to ask this question again but I'm asking this question um mainly for you know the the the the newcomers the new people that are coming on here um what is your favorite song off of fair warning and again what is your favorite Vin Halen album all right I already told y'all what mine mine is um y'all let me know what yours is in the comment section below and we going to keep rocking all right if

The station will reopen on May 19.","um you know regarding Palestine and Israel what are your thoughts who do you favor why listen at the end of the day if you look at it at a humanitarian perspective both sides are losing M 100% innocent lives on both ends are losing however people need to wake up and see that Hamas is a terror organization people are stuck in Gaza still a fifth of our 35 hostages were confirmed dead today they need to be home now actually a month ago two months ago they need to be home uh I'm with Israel what would you say okay sorry what what about you I agree with her I think Hamas is against the Palestinian people against the world against Israel and so we should all be fighting against Hamas for the sake of everyone globally because it also sends out a really dangerous message to everyone else like Hamas is a terrorist organization and so I support with Israel but it does not mean that I want violence against against the Palestinian people 100% agree with that one okay and what would y'all say to the people that are that say like Israel is committing genocide on Palestine do you agree disagree I think there that word is being used improperly okay how would you Des what how how is it improper and how would you describe it then so for starters why is Israel not allowed to defend themselves why is it portrayed in the media that Israel can't defend itself but it's okay for Hamas to send out rockets and kill and kill innocent lives that were at a festival for music and living freely so yeah that's my well a genocide is when you're trying to wipe out entire group of people this is a war and I don't think violence is any excuses on either side so I'm not saying it's an excuse but War comes with casualties and Hamas is the problem would sorry I didn't mean they did this podcast or I don't know exactly what it's called so I don't want to be quoted on that but it's called The Whispers in Gaza and you'll find that a lot of people are against Hamas it's just you can't openly be against Hamas on the Gaza Strip 100% they're hiding their people that couldn't move out of the area where Israel had let they let gave them a weak notice Flyers soldiers telling them that they need to move from this area and soldiers are even showing on video that they're saying that we can't leave because Hamas is shooting at us what do you so what about like in response to like um you said like they didn't want to wipe out like what about like the Prime Minister kind of referring to like taking out all of Palestine which prime minister Israel uhhuh he's not referring to okay wait can I just say one thing no absolutely so a lot of the people in Israel like the same way in the US even though you might live in Israel doesn't mean you're So Pro the government sure yeah of course so that's quite obious we have here left and the second thing is when families are coming crying about their children and other family members that have been taken and are being tortured to that extent people are going to get upset and want to see action okay and what about like oh sorry that being said Hamas is hiding in hospitals and so they're trying to hospitals schools houses underneath beds they lift them up and they see boms Hamas is trying to win a media war and that is why like a lot of the people that are for Israel if you look at that said there's not that many people coming here because at this point we're trying to like give money to to the bring them home now Foundation the IDF and trying to work behind the scenes because rallying is not really helping you think Hamas is going to stop or if you're on the other side you think the Israeli government is going to stop because they see a bunch of kids a bunch of people rallying in the park it's not proactive it doesn't make change and I think the most change could happen if everyone came together and understood that violence on either side is not okay but then you see people here the defending Hamas and saying Oh but you know they're Martyrs they're Freedom Fighters that is a spin in the face and anyone who thinks that is wrong is wrong because I'm not going to stand here and say you know I'm so like I'm not happy that violence is happening on either side but some people here are celebrating that so that's the difference it's it's Humanity here it's not politics it's not where you're from can I ask you one last question yeah okay fin question is how do you um as like right pro-israel people how do you justify like the death of 25,000 Palestinians I don't justify any death I don't think anyone should be dying I think once again like I said there's casualties I think like we both said that there's casualties on both ends of this war and I think that honestly both ends need to come to conclusion I had a great discussion with someone who was Muslim today and she was explaining to me how she sends her kids to a uh the JCC in their community in New Jersey and Jewish organization and she said that I'm here and I'm I'm for just to stop none of this is necessary like she just she said it in a way that you know sorry as I'm videotaping this I have two people laughing at me calling me names they let them say it to my face um no but like I said I don't justify anyone dying I believe in the humanitarian way where it's no such should be losing any lives and this should all stop and come to a conclusion um I just want to say there's there's no justification for any violence and the hard truth is war does come with death but it's still not justified but if you look around and see the people that are holding up all those posters with the crossover Israel's flag they're calling like I'm a great-granddaughter of Holocaust Survivors so for me it's straight up anti-em ISM regardless of what way you want to spin it this is not political this is blant anti-Semitism and most like I've grown up knowing about the conflict the conflict did not start on octo start on October 7th most of the people here do not even know that they saw it on Instagram and want to come and want to feel like an activist followers when they really have zero clue what they're talking about cool so all right thank you thank you  ",no longer populated,,2024-02-23T18:02:58.000Z,post data

15 is -6 and then + 6 gives me zero that's for -3 so this should be a zero if this is a parabola what should the y-coordinate of -2 be what should this be right here in this box should that also be a zero that should also be a zero because it's a parabola very nice so then I need to do only one more of these two I'm going to do ne1 that seems like it would be easier so here's my original equation it's kind of hard to see here x^2 + 5x + 6 I'm going to substitute -1 in for my X2 so the function of -1 being substituted in is -1 2ar + 5 * -1 + 6 Miss C should I write this down yes yes you should so you know where we're getting these answers I'm not just pulling them from the air the atmosphere so -1 SAR is how much 1 + 5 * -1 is5 or minus5 + 6 bless you got a new box of tissues over there if you need 1 - 5 is -4 and -4 + 6 is 2 so when X is -1 my y-coordinate is 2 which means when I have -4 is my x coordinate it also should be two because we're talking about parabolas all right now let's plot our scheme no let's plot our graph really nothing okay all right so um let's go we did the vertex already it's right here let's go to -20 that means it is right on the x axis and -12 is putting it right there and if I do these two here -30 is right here on the xais and -42 is right there connect with a gentle [Music] curve we didn't have to find the parent graph or is this the parent graph is this the original F ofx or is this the G of X really it's the G of X it's not the parent graph because it's been moved okay so this is my new and improved graph so so as I look the directions here are below the table say the X intercepts are blank and blank x intercepts have to be on the x-axis where Y is equal to zero you can also Circle them carefully so what are my X intercepts here say it again yes -2 and -3 are the X intercepts so what do you think the solution are -2 and -3 so when you visually see that the parabola crosses the x axis that is your solution or those are your solution because you can have Zero Solutions one solution or two solutions any questions about that table so we were not totally off but it did rattle me a bit just to be honest all right so we did the bottom we talked about a double root and how that is when your Parabola just touches the line and bounces back off it's one solution but you have two factors Somebody's knocking at the door I believe we also talked about example three so here is a parabola it doesn't even cross the xaxis so we have no real number Solutions sometimes we call that the null set you can write it like this here's the name null set or we just say no real solutions okay no real solutions good morning any questions about any anything up to factoring review okay all right let's start going through this factoring review this is a review from what you did at the end of last semester and the beginning of this semester types of factoring so number one if we have any amount of terms what should I look for and do first GC look for a GCF greatest common factor these are the steps you all right T okay um if we have only two terms and we've already looked for the greatest common factor what should I look for here if I only have two terms maybe I should put GCF first so GCF first and then what anyone it's a difference of two squares very good difference of two perfect squares or difference of two squares all right so number three if you have three terms you always look for the greatest common factor first and then we do what kind of factoring Xbox yes and the last one if we have four terms we always look for a greatest common factor first and then we do Factor by grouping yes all right so this is a blast from the past we will need to be using this here in the near future so that's why we are going over it again we're just going to go through as many problems as we can here and I would like to give you some time to work on your homework too so the directions say and it's always important to read the directions first Factor the following polinomial remember to look for a GCF okay all right so 6x squ - 9x do I have a greatest common factor yes and what would it be 3x so you can either show it to me here or if you are past that point you can bring it out front and say 6 / 3 is 2 X2 / X is x minus 9 / 3 is 3 and x / x 1 3 * 1 is 3 so here is your final answer so that one just had a greatest common factor any questions about that okay let's go to number two 14 x y to 6 + 21 x to the 5th y to the 3 what do I do first here GC GCF garlic cheese fries yes no not garlic cheese fries what is my greatest common factor here how about for just 14 and 21 seven okay what about these X's how many many X's can I factor out of both IE one she says good answer good answer how many y's can I factor out of both three it's always the smallest amount when it comes to the variables because it's not common if you can't include them all so that is my GCF but I need to factor it so 7 y 7 X Y 3r 14 / 7 is 2 x / X is 1 so 2 * 1 is 2 y to the 6 / y to the 3 y to the 3 yes you subtract those exponents plus 21 ID 7 is 3 x to the 5th / X X 4th and y 3/ y 3 simplifies out to be 1 * 1 is just that all right now take a look at this is there anything that we can factor out of that no so that is your oops final answer questions there all right let's go to the next page we have three four five six seven and eight o those bottom three those are all trinomials all right x^2 - 16 what should I do first saon and do I have one no I do not so this this has that two terms what is this called again Anthony you told us before difference of two squares so I need to rewrite these as two squares which is X2 - 4^ 2ar okay and when you have the difference of two squares you might not remember if you have a squ minus b^ 2 that is equal to a + b * a - b so here my X is my a value so I'm going to say X plus 4 four is my B value I should use a different color x + 4 * x - four this is my favorite kind of factoring because I'm like man that's fast yes say it again get where did I get the four from because I need to find some number squared that gives me 16 and since 16 is a perfect square meaning I could do a square with four on each side um that would be four on each side so 4 * 4 gives me that 16 which makes up the B squared okay good question any questions any more questions about three all right Joelle come on Joelle come on I know I'm interrupting but here we go number four talk to me about four that is a nice problem yes yes it is talk to me about four come on Sydney talk to me about it what do you notice what do You observe perfect squares yes they are perfect squares so should I jump right in and do difference of two squares good what should I do G look for a GCF F because it will make a difference so do I have a GCF here yeah what is it four four yeah I can divide both of these by four so four is my greatest common factor that factor comes out front 4 / 4 is 1 and X2 is all by itself minus 36 to ID 4 is [Music] 9 wow that is a totally different difference of squares Now isn't it so yes now we look at this and say yeah that's a difference of squares so four we're just going to keep bringing out front this x squar is already squared minus what squared gives me nine three excellent three squ write it down first So my answer here is going to be 4 * quantity now these are both squared so it's going to be x + 3 * x -3 and this is your final answer do you see why I love difference of two squares it's just it's quick right I think it's quick any questions on four what do you need help with on four okay let's move on let me take a look at these all right we'll do five let's do five so first of all we say do I have a GCF and you look at it and you're like well my coefficient one and they don't all have X's so that's a big no right away okay let's do Xbox a * C at the top so 1 * -4 is -4 at the bottom is your -5 which is your B value which means my larger digited number is going to be negative so I need factors of -4 that add up to a -5 I'm 8 and three okay all right so let's go with the Box Justice what goes in the upper left hand corner four no not four it's going to be your first term your ax so that's going to be just X SAR right here okay uh what about in the bottom box I'm coming back to you no no it's going to be -4 okay -4 you might want to write down some of this a few of it okay okay all right and the middle muddle is going to be these two that we found multiplied by X so 8X and positive 3x greatest common factor time so x^2 and 3X what is my greatest common factor Toby right here greatest common factor of those two x greatest common factor of these thomas8 excellent how about in The Columns X2 and8 X how [Music] about Morgan Brooks Morgan right how about here x^2 and 8x what is that going to be X yes and how about 3x and -24 Miss Trinity uh uh what is the greatest common factor of 3x and -4 three yes positive three so rewrite them x - 8 * x + 3 that is your factorization there miss the can I have x + 3 * x - 8 is that the same thing well well is it is it yeah 5 * 4 is the same as 4 * 5 all right I say we do one more of these three which one would you like to do no let's not do six okay which one between seven and eight shoot I think I should have picked seven but okay eight we'll do eight I asked didn't I all right so number eight what do I look for first when factoring GCF GCF when a doubt just say GCF right no not always do I have a greatest common factor here 9 16 and4 I know right an extra little step look at you thinking like a teacher don't worry I won't tell anybody do I have a GCF in 8 no I don't all right so we need to do the Xbox a * C is 9 * your -4 - 36 B is 16 whoa Nelly what do we got here so factors that multiply to give you -6 and add to give you 16 136 2 and 18 whoop whoop whoop there it is whoop there it is and so 2 and 18 but one of them's got to be negative -2 because the 16 is positive your larger digited number would be positive you guys know that song There It Is there it is do you know that one yeah okay good all right so here is my original trinomial what goes in that first box Joelle this first box in the upper leftand corner wearing the green trunks I don't think that's correct no 9x2 the first term goes in the first Corner 9x squared all right Justice coming back to you what comes in this bottom last square4 no too high it is the last amount the last term -4 there you go and the two middle muddles are -2 and 18 multiplied with the X okay then I've got to find greatest common factor between 9 X2 and 18x T what do you think 9 x there you go how about -2X and4 TJ say it again not an X this one doesn't have an X NE -2 yes I like how you added that negative there right Angel 9x2 and -2X 2 does two divide into nine not evenly so it's just going to be X nothing between 9 and -2 except for one and the last one 18x and -4 two yes plus two so my final answer should be 9x - 2 times the factor x + 2 bada boom bada bing questions about that problem okay great work today guys great work you may remember I gave you a homework paper those of you that were absent yesterday I'll give you one so this is homework 12.3 and it is due tomorrow okay try to get it done and to me tomorrow all right use this time D was like eh all right I need to get one to Joelle and Thomas great job guys  ,no longer populated,,2024-02-08T17:35:43.000Z,post data removed,https://www.junkipedia.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCSWN3MkJnPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--306e22231a98ecfde68d89c9e0453035f3e72a5e/post-7167-195839683-thumbnail,0,0,0,56,,

Today, 23 year old specialist Brianna Moffett&#39;s mother says she&#39;s proud of her daughter. I was the first female in the family to join the military. So she became the second, the widow of 46 year old sergeant, William Rivers tells WSB he loved the army and took care of his family. And the parents of 24 year old specialist Kennedy Sanders say she had a contagious smile and liked to laugh. You remember her service and the commitment and the sacrifice she made for the country. Sander&#39;s mother recalls when she realized something was wrong. Try to facetime Kennedy twice um tried to text her and call her. Of course, no answer. Meanwhile, the president and Pentagon vowed to strike back. We will take all necessary actions to defend the US and our troops. Officials say Iran backed militants sent the drone to the US outpost on the Jordan Syria border. The Pentagon says confusion between it and a US drone is how it got past defenses.

Police say it all started when a man reportedly stabbed two people and then the police officer 11 alive, Joe Ripley live outside of that five point station. So Joe, you&#39;re there. Can you paint a picture for us? What does the scene look like right now as of right now, Marta, police say there&#39;s no longer a public safety concern or risk at this point. That&#39;s certainly some good news. And as you look behind me here, you&#39;ll notice the scene much quieter than what we saw earlier today. The entrances here on the Peachtree Street side to the five point station now back open passengers now allowed to enter from this side of the station. Here&#39;s a look at what the same scene looked like earlier today, crime scene tape bordering this corner of the station blocking folks from getting inside on the side of the street. This all stemming from the incident that happened around 11 a.m. Marta police saying a man stabbed two people just outside of the five point station. An officer patrolling the area was checking out the commotion when police say the man stabbed the officer in the hand. The officer then fired twice, hitting the suspect in the leg and stomach. The GB I is now investigating and charges are pending against the suspect. Marta Police deputy chief, Willie Davenport says he&#39;s thankful no one lost their life. Uh We&#39;re very thankful that I also was on uh patrolling the station alert. Our number one priority is the patriot and employee, their safety murder. Police say the officer involved in the shooting had to go to the hospital and get stitches for his hand, the suspect and two victims in this case. Also in the hospital right now, they are in stable condition at last check ahead at five. We are checking in with Marty police to see how they&#39;re ramping up uh security here amid concerns as this is the second violent incident at this same five point session in less than a month.

This comes after a man was stabbed to death on the train platform.,"New tonight at six. Marta is now talking about plans to boost safety at the five point station after a man was stabbed to death on the train platform. This morning, 11 lives bo Ys joining us live in that. I know you&#39;ve been speaking to officials today about these changes. Well, Jonathan officials spent the morning cleaning up that deadly scene before reopening this mo station back up to riders. But those officials tell me safety is their top priority and they&#39;re working to make sure increasing security and making sure that this doesn&#39;t happen again. And we are beefing up the station from four officers to six officers. Major Eugene Roberts with Marta. Police says changes are underway after the most recent incident that claimed the life of a rider at the five points Marta station. I&#39;m a person was stabbed this morning down on the northbound platform. The suspect was taken into custody immediately. Marta identified the person as 48 year old Jason Harris and the stabbing is putting those who use the five points. Marta station frequently on edge. I really don&#39;t feel safe riding martyr behind what happened? Kimberly Niles is among several Marty riders reacting to the death. I feel like I&#39;m risking my life every single time I come downtown. To be honest, I do and she&#39;s not alone. I&#39;ve seen incidents, I&#39;ve heard incidents. I feel like I need to be on guard at all times. I feel like awareness is everything and pay attention to your surroundings. But some writers believe the issue goes beyond Marta, it&#39;s going on all over. So it&#39;s like it ain&#39;t just a modern station. It&#39;s a world thing. There&#39;s people still as Marta moves forward with increasing security at the five point station writes, we spoke to say the changes can&#39;t come soon enough. I really do hope they do something quickly and get more polices or more mar polices down here to make sure everyone is safe because I don&#39;t have a car right now. So I have to say Marta to get back in front to work to go to the grocery store. Anything I do. I have to take Marta. Now, officials tell us they&#39;re still working to contact that victim&#39;s family members and until then they won&#39;t be able to release that person&#39;s information. We&#39;ll bring you updates when we get it, sending it back to you. All right. Well, Beth, thank you so much.

I&#39;m Ron Jones. Dekalb County leaders and Marta executives breaking ground on a brand new housing community in Dekalb 11 lives. Tracy A MP has a look at the size of the future housing development near Decatur. This development will bring hundreds of affordable units right here to Dekalb County and right next door to a Marta station that groundbreaking like music to my ears. Dekalb County commissioner Larry Johnson along with other Dekalb leaders and Marta executives broke ground on Wednesday at the site of a development focused on access to public transportation and affordable housing on Kensington Road near Decatur. This huge project, a partnership between Marta who owns the land and Dekalb County dekalb Housing Authority. They&#39;re bringing them together the county helped with the zoning to make sure that we can have a mixed use in our community. So that&#39;s the type of partnership that we need the pledge by Marta and the county to make 100% of the housing affordable. That&#39;s around 260 units for seniors and working families. Marta GM and Ceo Collie Greenwood says the focus on addressing the community&#39;s needs. A third of the people in Dekalb spend 30% of their income, their monthly income on housing. And then we know that transportation is the second largest burden on household income. So if we can take care of both of those things in one tandem effort, then it&#39;s a beautiful day. This development will also house the new headquarters for the Housing Authority of Dekalb County. And amenities will include soccer fields and weekly farmers market. All these units directly next door to the Kensington Marta station. Its progress and its hope and it&#39;s the future in terms of people that work hard and really deserve to be able to get the most they can for their dollars. The housing here on Kensington Road is set to fully open in 2028 and residents will apply through the county&#39;s Housing Authority in Dekalb County. I&#39;m Tracy A MC. 11 live news right now, support continues to pour in for the hundreds of people impacted by a massive apartment fire just before the Thanksgiving holiday. An organization out of Alabama is actually helping, helping those fire victims. Right now. 11 lives. Cody Alcorn shows us how the United Cajun Navy is stepping up donating a semi truck load of winter coats and relief supplies to hatching hope. An organization out of Pelham Alabama. We&#39;re just excited to be able to provide some comfort and joy to these people. During such a dark time, hundreds of residents forced out of their homes no time to grab their belongings as the fire spread through an entire building at the Reserve in La Vista. Walk back on November 10. Many losing everything. Something that hits close to home for the founder of Hatching Hope. Keeley Lynch Wright, you see here helping unload the donations. Her assistant Jessica Trahan explains, she lost her house to a fire in 2010. And so when she launched, Hatching, hope it was a way to pay it even if it means traveling more than 100 and 50 miles from their base in Alabama. We obviously saw it on the news and knew that we had to jump in and get involved in that, especially when there are this many people impacted by it. And we&#39;re talking hundreds of families. We knew that we needed to do what we could to just bring some comfort and joy to them. Just what we&#39;re here for. We&#39;re here to serve in times of crisis. A Clark Atlanta student is one of 27 in the entire nation to receive the bridging the dream scholarship. When I initially found out I had won the scholarship. My mom, she told me first and I was like, wait, are you serious? She&#39;s like, yeah, I was like, oh my God, like I started screaming and running around the house, the $10,000 scholarship from the College Planning Corporation, Sally Mae was awarded to Clark Atlanta University Freshman Dominique Lee. Now this was meant to help students from historically underserved communities make their dreams of higher education. A reality. Dominique is one of eight Atlanta H BC U students awarded this scholarship. The business major says that he hopes to carry the legacy of his H BC U through his degree. I personally believe I wouldn&#39;t be getting as good an education. I am at any other institution. So here at Clark, it&#39;s not just business, it&#39;s how are you going to do business as a black male in society in the future? Dominique says that he hopes to attend law school and lend his voice to help advocate for those without one. The legacy of a hero will forever be remembered in the halls of Roswell High School. A nonprofit organization is honoring the life of a former student who died in combat in 2009, 11 lives. Arian Moniz has his story, Marine of the year twice. The stars and stripes of this flat tell the story of a hero. He won the bronze star two times purple heart marine gunnery sergeant, Aaron M kick the son of Roswell and hero of America, a great athlete. He was a hero who died in September 2009 in combat during operation. Enduring freedom. This flag will now forever hang in the hallways of Roswell High School where he graduated in 1997 to commemorate his bravery, 100 years from now. And that is still hanging here. And we&#39;ll remember Sergeant Mike Morgan Ceo of the nonprofit flags for the fallen, created the flag in Ken&#39;s honor. His passion for woodwork in honoring fallen service members birthed the organization two years ago when we lost for 13 heroes in Afghanistan. I couldn&#39;t get it out of my head. So I said, I&#39;m going to make 13 flags a heartfelt appreciation from the families of the 13 soldiers listed. Kept him going. Don&#39;t stop with us. Morgan didn&#39;t stop. He&#39;s now honored the lives of over 200 fallen service members and first responders with custom wooden flags. He says the flags represent for the families that their loved one won&#39;t be forgotten. Like the family of gunnery sergeant Kenne who donated a flag to the high school. I hope that our students will be able to truly, I what it means to serve and protect our country, which will now serve as a reminder to the students of today about his bravery and courage to be able to have something um, that our students can see and to see how um those that have fallen before us, how they&#39;re paving that way for generations to come and what it means to pay. The ultimate sacrifice motivates them, or they just see what greatness came from another student that walked the same halls as they did. That&#39;s that, that&#39;d be great for them. We have an incredible update to a story we brought to you earlier this fall. It&#39;s about a little baby boy named Liam who has been fighting for his life since he was born back in March. Liam, diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder was given a 5050 chance of survival shortly after birth, his only cure was a liver transplant. Our very own Brittney Klein Peter brought you this story back in September, sharing that neither of Liam&#39;s parents were eligible candidates. However, recently doctors discovered Liam had grown big enough for his dad to be a match. The two recently underwent that life saving procedure. Liam&#39;s mom says that they&#39;re now focusing on that long road to recovery and if you would like to help support the family, you can find a link on the love it alive.com. Well, as you know, it&#39;s the spirit of giving all across metro Atlanta. One Cobb County restaurant celebrated Thanksgiving by feeding others. 11 lives. Don White shares their story. Marietta Wings and Moore is well known in the community for what&#39;s in its name. Everybody knows that if you go over there, we&#39;re going to have some chicken wings owner, Cam Newich, made sure people got not only wings but some traditional Thanksgiving food as well, you know, just like a rice glove is our very famous, you know, yellow rice rice pil. And along with the rice has a turkey, turkey breast new, wanted to make sure those from all walks of life have something to be thankful for on Thanksgiving Day. Besides like it&#39;s not about the homeless. It&#39;s also a lot of people, they don&#39;t have a plan to have a dinner or they don&#39;t have a lot. So they also come, it&#39;s a gesture those who may not otherwise have a Thanksgiving meal, say they appreciate. Thank you so much. Ok, happy Thanksgiving everybody. We just keep in mind that well, the community give us a lot of business. So one day we can give them back a go to resource, supporting foster kids in Gwinnett County is now in need of the community&#39;s help. 11 lives, Liza Lucas brings us the mission of the wrapped in love closet and the group&#39;s efforts for more support to keep that mission going. It&#39;s the things taken for granted, shoes, a coat, a bit of comfort that&#39;s found through these doors. Everything that you could think of that a child would need is in this closet. Andrea Barkley is the founder and CEO of because One matters, the group operates the wrapped in love clothing closet here in Lawrenceville, serving kids going through foster care. The organization provides clothing, toiletries, toys, books, and more to the Children for free a need that Gwinnett County Juvenile Court judge, young guy Sims sees all the time in her courtroom. Many of these Children have been removed from their home and it&#39;s kind of a last minute situation. They, if they&#39;re lucky, are able to grab maybe a trash bag and throw in some clothes. But the clothing closet about more than just the basics. This closet is helping them to feel comfort, feel love and give them a little bit of dignity. They&#39;re able to come here, they can get some clothes, some toiletries um, for the younger kids toys, something that make them feel a little bit more comfortable. But that source of help faces its own uncertain future. The building which houses the closet recently sold and the group must now move by the end of the year, we&#39;re in a crisis. If we don&#39;t find a place that we can afford or someone donate to us, we will be forced to close our doors with the holidays here. Andrea says the need is high, but she&#39;s holding on to hope that a helping hand will come through without this resource. It&#39;s going to have a negative impact on the community that we serve because the families they need us. The countdown is now on to find a new home for the organization before the end of the year. The hope is maybe someone in the community has a space they could donate. Perhaps right here in Lawrenceville. The goal is to stay close to the DAC office and the kids they serve in Lawrenceville.

1). Marta ""Missing"" $50 Million
2). Pro-Palestine Rally in Midtown
3). New T4echnology for Firefighters","don't don't push it back that was that was just a question that wasn't hello everybody this is Alan delin with Atlanta news first thank you so much for joining me here at the First Alert desk this fine Thursday November 9th we're going to walk through some of our top stories today because there's been a lot of stuff going on today honestly it's been pretty busy let me select this real quick so I can make sure you guys can see more of what I'm trying to show you there we go so again walking through the top stories here for this evening and then after that we're going to have cutter Martin who is fresh out of the North Carolina Tennessee Georgia shared border area up North to talk to you about not only the weather but also about a wildfire that's been raging up there for a while now thankfully it's 99% contained but it has been a battle we'll get to that as soon as I'm done with these top stories we're going to jump right into it and we're going to start with a story um done by Atlanta news first reporter Patrick Quinn who was talking about how there are are allegations that there has been millions of dollars that has gone misplaced or mishandled in the MARTA budget he got to the bottom of today and asked the right players here's that story did you know that Marta's own numbers show that more than $50 million has gone missing from Mor Marta $50 million allegedly missing from Atlanta's Mor Marta program a $2.7 billion project funded by a half penny sales tax passed by Atlanta voters in 2016 this claim of missing funds is coming from not just anybody but Gregory ngi who was a Deputy Commissioner for Atlanta's Department of Transportation here he is presenting to the Atlanta City Council in March good morning everybody uh my name is Douglas Nagi I'm Deputy Commissioner for strategy and planning uh within atld do ngi who now works in the private sector says based on Marta financials he acquired while with the city Marta allocated $ 57.3 million for bus enhancements from 2020 to 2023 and yet he claims those enhancements never happened that same period Atlanta didn't get really any expanded bus service so what did this $57 million go to if it didn't go to this someone better start answering in March the city launched an audit into the mor Marta program at the time council president Doug Shipman called on Marta CEO collie Greenwood to provide records of how Marta leadership approved more Marta funds for bus enhancements is there a document like the 2018 letter that codified that uh significant change that you've been able to find I'll I'll look for it that's um that's a great question and today Atlanta City Council president Doug Shipman told me he has still not gotten that documentation now Marta responded to these allegations today a spokesperson telling me that CEO colie Greenwood told the city of Atlanta quote we are working to True up the sustaining Capital cost based on actual expenditures and the remaining money will be placed in the more Marta Atlanta reserves from Marta's Lindberg Center Patrick Quinn Atlanta news first so a lot more to come from that one Patrick's going to stay on top of it he's going to carry it live this evening beginning at 10:00 so you can tune in to Atlanta news first for more on that story the next story I'm going to talk to you guys about here is a rally that's currently happening right now in downtown Midtown um a pro Palestine rally and they are outside of the consulate out there right now Joshua Skinner is going to carry that for us this evening here's a sneak peek at what's been happening here pretty much all day I'm Joshua Skinner at the Israeli consulate in Midtown where a pro Palestinian Gathering is being held outside the Israeli consulate tonight as part of the global shutdown for the Palestinian day of action protesters are demanding the US stop sending Aid to Israel that's total $130 billion since 1948 people waving Palestinian Flags holding up signs here at the corner of 12th in Spring the rally began at 600 p.m. a sit in expected to continue all night and again that's happening it's still happening right now there are are expectations that some people will be out there well beyond midnight into the early morning hours so Joshua skin is going to continue to cover that bring us to latest again he'll be live on Atlanta news first at 10 and 11 and last but not least a good news story for you guys some new technologies being introduced to fire trucks in our area that will allow firefighters to get better decontaminated when they leave those burning buildings because with all that burning comes a whole lot of toxic chemicals smoke debris and then inhale it all in so this right here is a firestorm stick it's going to be attached to the back of fire trucks to do just that get all of that chemical and debris off of our firefighters to better protect them believe it or not the leading cause of death for firefighters is not uh anything that actually happens on the job it's illnesses it's disease it's cancer that comes from things like asbest and other components of building materials that are just toxic for you when you actually set it on fire just like these firefighters are dealing with dealing with pretty much every single day so what we're going to have is this technology right here that's going to allow firefighters to better be protected better keep themselves safe and then allow themselves to go home without actually bringing any of that contamination into their own being or their own houses or whatever you'd want to call it and that is uh another good component of this this whole scenario here uh Chelsea B for was covering that today and there's much more of that on our website right now at atlantan so as promised here this evening um before I bring in Cutter Martin I want to give you guys a live look right now over looking Hartsville Jackson Atlanta International Airport because what we have is another gorgeous beautiful day but we're not going to have it for to long I'll tell you that right now because what we've got is cold temperatures and some rain coming in here this evening and I'm going to bring in meteorologist I'm laughing at him for a reason don't worry about it guys meteorologist cut him Martin who has joined me now all the way back from way up North with um I guess cutter you out there and for some reason my video won't click over here let me hold it give me a second boom oh oh There boom almost there o still we're going to put heartsfield in the back how about that there he is cut Martin joins us now C you were uh out chasing wildfires today uh you know more or less uh bringing good news uh 99% contained fire it was the Walker County Georgia 157 fire right there on the highway only a few structures threatened Allen but good news today bad news and we're going to talk about this in the forecast drought it continues wish we could get some rain yeah and hoping we can in fact in the forecast as we shift gears here first SL forecast rain is on the way especially for Middle Georgia on into Metro Atlanta unfortunately though it is looking like that the chance of rain is going to be a little bit lower rain total is a little bit lighter lighter and Rain coverage a little spottier across far Northern and Northwestern portions of the state so we're going to be watching the potential for rain again you're looking at the current drought monitor fresh data in today and notice Walker County portions up to tuga County under an exceptional drought that is the highest level drought it is an exceptional scene up there and what's even sadder to see lakes on the way up to that Wildfire coverage today uh for example alauna it was low there were there were 67 ft of of exposed kind of mud and Shoreline that typically isn't there typically it's below water like laner our camera in Hall County has also showed Lake water really receding here docks and and marinas now fairly low still able to get in and out on the boats but but lake levels are fairly low and contining to get lower so rain is coming at at the perfect time we need rain good angle this late a good news I should say rather than than having this rain in the summertime where it rains and then like that it evaporates the sun Angle now lower so the moisture in the soil tends to stick around a little bit longer and you have a little bit less evaporation so that's good news again away from the drought monitor we're going to show you radar we're going to zoom way way out here let you know where it's raining at the moment and when that rain may arrive in North Georgia and Metro Atlanta again this is a look at radar we're going to shift radar modes here so you can see just a little bit more and now that we zoom out look back towards Texas Arkansas all the way back to Mexico so we're talking you know as the crow flies many many miles of rain in fact we can measure this so from the Chihuahuan Desert in northeastern Mexico all the way back up to you know portions of Kentucky uh there is a decent amount of rain falling right now we're going to get the measurement of this at the moment looking at you know about a, miles worth of rain and that's good news now unfortunately it's not impacting us just yet uh but we are going to be watching this track pretty closely into our area and eventually into to our area as we get into the day tomorrow so let's begin with that forecast we keep it dry tonight no rain issues uh the clouds probably notice those temperature is a little bit mild and out the door tomorrow morning notice all of the light greens there even some yellows that is relatively you know as far as the season is concerned mild temperatures certainly warmer than it should be warmer than average for the time of morning the time of year low temperatures tomorrow morning warmer than 60 in Atlanta blairesville 55 up around reward today Dalton Georgia 57 59 in Rome out the door numbers in the mid-50s Carolton and lrange mid upper 50s Athens Covington and in Griffin morning commute tomorrow we're going to be watching that potential for some moisture to start spreading in the possibility of some rain to start to fall even early tomorrow especially as we get into the after Sunrise period and then on into midm morning we'll walk you through the hour by hour forecast model doing a decent job with where it's raining now so gives us you know forecasters meteorologist uh more more confidence in how the forecast will evolve and notice how clouds do increase early tomorrow morning maybe the first few sprinkles 6 7: a.m. north and west of Atlanta and I think the first few sprinkles a little bit of light rain will move in after sunrise and then really midm morning on into early afternoon so if you have lunch plans tomorrow maybe a lunch meeting get the indoor seat we're going to be dealing with a little bit of moisture around tomorrow morning temperatures in the 60s climbing towards 70 tomorrow afternoon and then as the rain picks up made to late afternoon some of that cooler air also starts to filter in in our temperatures will start to cool so tomorrow evening's commute could be rather damp at least for a time though rain not heavy not too too significant and temperatur is initially tomorrow evening relatively mild in the 60s but notice by 10 p.m. you're already back in the upper 50s whereas this evening we're in the mid upper 60s so uh it'll be quite a difference tomorrow and then the rain really built in tomorrow night Saturday morning here we are 8: a.m. widespread rain temperatures in the low to mid-50s a chilly gloomy Dam Monday ahead First Alert to that we're talking rain waves of rain on through the morning on into the afternoon here we are 400 p.m. temperatures low to mid-50s going deeper into tomorrow evening still in the low to mid-50s we're just kind of stuck there all day with rounds of rain and Gloom in the First Alert forecast and want to remind you this is a good kind of pause Point letting you know that we are live across several platforms right now if you have any other questions comments concerns maybe you need some clarification on the forecast again feel free to reach out on YouTube right now we are live Atlanta news first is the account to like and to follow and the account that we're streaming on right now also First Alert weather app Atlanta newsfirst app the atlantan newws first.com the website Roku Amazon fir stick if you have any other questions comments concerns the place to be would be YouTube though Atlanta news first it's just the account to like and to follow the one we're streaming in on right now so maybe if you're watching Roku all on Roku all you have to do is open up your phone go to YouTube Atlanta news first is the place that I'll be monitoring just out a shot hear the comments coming in and we will be answering any questions comments concerns that we may see coming in especially about this weekend's forecast again First Alert trending cooler and wetter as we get into the weekend rain is going to be a factor for many Saturday plans hence the First Alert the heads up rain and issue may not be incredibly heavy but it will be rather persistent on and off all day long and more on than off in reality and then Sunday night and Monday maybe a little Sunday night rather Saturday night into Sunday morning we have a little bit of a lull though not done here we are deeper into the forecast here Saturday night more rain is developing early Sunday morning rain is picking back up again and could be moderate to locally heavy at times Sunday morning with temperatures in the 40s and 50s clouds light Breeze it will be very very gloomy so heads up hopefully got your outdoor errands outdoor chores outdoor work anything you needed to get done hopefully you got that done today because the first few sprinkles arrive tomorrow not a wash out of a day but a little bit of moisture around certainly more clouds not as warm as today today uh of course approaching 80 in many spots I think it's 71 tomorrow afternoon in Atlanta 58 Saturday afternoon and we're stuck upper 40s lower 50s Sunday afternoon cold rain for Veterans Day obviously a day in which many people are are remembering veterans and having uh having moments of recognition outside you will need the umbrellas and it remains cool into next week 40s to near 50 afternoons 50 60s lots of clouds we're kind of sliding into a gloomy pattern with a greater at least periods of Greater rain chances that is good news for so many that are in severe uh to exceptional drought conditions uh obviously those that are dealing with wildfires uh spoke with Gabe Outlaw public information officer a Forester with the Georgia Forestry commission today and he was saying yesterday 34 new wildfires were ignited across the state not just in our area but Statewide 34 new fires yesterday alone all contained none threatening any properties no injuries related to those fires nonetheless showing you how dry it is and how easy it is for fires wildfires to begin across uh the state not just here in North Georgia so Rain Is a Good Thing it has been sung and sng and a certainly is is truth and it's reality in this 7-day forecast rain is on the way we need it Veterans Day First Alert Sunday First Alert weather weather is on the way and First Alert meteorologist Fred Campa hyper forecast tonight starting at 10 p.m. in just a little bit Atlanta news first on Peach Tree TV Atlanta CW affiliate also Atlanta news first back on WF at 11 p.m. for the late news and a reminder you can always get that forecast in the First Alert weather app and at atlantan C we'll leave you with a live look currently dry runways at Hartsfield Jackson at Atlanta International Airport but rain is on the way for your weekend plans  ",no longer

So, so what&#39;s the status now? That&#39;s right, Ron, after that man was shot and killed while sitting on the bench. This murder entrance was blocked off from 130 until about an hour ago. And if you look behind me, you can see crews are actually sanitizing the streets and the sidewalk in that area. Let&#39;s take a look at some video we got when we first arrived, police say the man who was shot was sitting on the bench in front of the station entrance when he was struck by a bullet. Investigators were quickly able to track down the suspect who they was still in the area. Now, police say they&#39;re still working to determine what happened leading up to the shooting and they tell us right now they don&#39;t know if there is a connection between the shooter and the man who died. We spoke with a major from the Marta Police Department who tells us they have taken statements, they&#39;ve been reviewing surveillance video and they&#39;ve been interviewing witnesses. Now, the identities of the man who died and the shooter have not been released. But we&#39;ll bring you more details as they become available back to you.

a story that we broke
at noon and Atlanta charter school was
placed under lockdown while police were active
in the area. Officers were reportedly
searching for a
wanted person near Centennial Academy that&#39;s
on Lucky Street Northwest. We&#39;re told Atlanta public
schools officers assisted a PD
in and around
the school. Now during the lockdown, no one
was allowed in or out
of the building. Students have since been
dismissed for
the day. We of course, will keep you

The agency said in a release that Muhammed Bilal El-Amin was captured by the Oconee County Sheriff's Office, near Athens, in the course of the traffic stop.

He'd had a FBI reward out for his arrest since the early 2000s, after allegedly shooting a man in the face with a handgun at the Oakland City MARTA station in Atlanta in November 1994.

It could be a dream combination for some kids. It can be, and starting today, students at Atlanta Public Schools will be able to use the video game to envision a better future for their city. APS joined Mayor Andre Dickens to launch the Level Up Atlanta Minecraft Student Bill Challenge, and students had to answer just one question. How can we envision a connected, equitable and sustainable future that moves Atlanta forward but leaves no one behind? So Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens got some help from 5th grader John Howard, and this level up challenge allows students like Howard to reimagine 4 different Atlanta landmarks using an education based version of that popular game, Minecraft. The goal here is to teach students critical thinking. The Minecraft Challenge is is stimulating young minds and trying to get them creative, open minded, trying to be risk takers.

and killed
a man at an apartment complex
and then
stole a French bulldog as they
made their escape. Tonight we&#39;re learning more abot the man who was gunned down, as neighbors tell us they&#39;re now afraid to walk their own dogs. The apartment complex sits along Garson Drive Northeast near the Lindbergh Center Marta station. That&#39;s where Teresa Bowles brins us the latest. Jeremy Scott left for brunch and came home to what he describes as a movie scene. I&#39;m head start carrying my pist. If we in the wild, Wild
West, somebody need to let me know. Crime scene tape, dozens of police units, investigators everywhere, all before 2:00 in the afternoon. This is by
daylight on
a Sunday. I just moved in here
so I&#39;m wondering if I picked the wrong
place. The victim, identified as 22 year
old Jayden McKinnon, was shot outside the Willow
Weston Lindbergh apartment complex. Officers responded and located e victim of the shooting who was g attended to by residents. McKinn was later pronounced dead
at the hospital. Witnesses tell us off camera tht he was simply walking his dog and then something went wrong. Atlanta police haven&#39;t
confirmed that, but mentioned that there is a French bulldog involved. The photos of the adorable Frene are spreading on social media. Scott says this sequence of eves is coming as a complete shock to this canine loving community. I have a standard poodle which is a very coveted brief. This is Miss Blanche Marie and f someone tried to take my dog I d act very aggressively
as well. Police are still investigating what led up to the shooting so far. Officers later. Covered a vehice that fled during a traffic stop. However, no one is in custody, nor do we know who the suspect is. We are investigating the circumstances surrounding
the shooting. We are looking at some leads. We have recovered a vehicle that left the scene that we believe was involved. So all people were doing on Suny night were merely speculating about how this tragic turn of events could happen while keeping their heads on a swivel. Ready to protect their furry friends or themselves if need be. If that&#39;s indeed
what happened. That&#39;s troubling and
we do have security here, but I guess they
don&#39;t do much. In Atlanta, Teresa Bowles,

Doug Richards has the details. The Atlanta Streetcar
has had greater visibility than it
has had ridership, but putting it on the wildly popular Eastside, Beltline advocates say, could change tha. I like to bike sometimes.
I walk.
Ohh I love it because there&#39;s
a lot of energy in it. Few Atlanta amenities have the devoted following of the Atlanta Belt line. Walk and run and stroll, skatin, biking, walking, running. Yet the trail is incomplete without public transit. Running alongside the pedestrian walkway, say backers like Matthew Rao, I think it finally delivers a promise to many of te folks who moved there 10 or 15 s ago when this was promised. Bute fans of the Beltline aren&#39;t sold on that promise. I think it boils down to one thing, and that&#39;s space. If it&#39;s if it, if it becomes too congested. Is the public transit plan for the Beltline and extension of the streetcar that has run for 8 1/2 years with very few passengers. The existing streetcar line runs mostly on a loop through downto. The extension would take a North by Northeast route and connect with the Beltline at Irwin Stre. From there, the streetcar woulde five stops on a 1 1/2 mile streh along the Belt Lines East Side l before reaching Ponce de Leon A. They can arrive by
a scooter
on foot, on bicycle and they can
go home on Streetcar Michael. Brown says the new roue will connect 10s of thousands of new residents who have moved into trendy properties near the Beltline over the last decade. t it&#39;s also a tough sell
for some users. Beltline is sports, It&#39;s

Runners will be lining up for a 4th of July tradition, the 2023 A JC Peachtree Rd. race. Tuesday, thousands will be battling their way through 6.2 miles down Peachtree Rd. Peachtree is always a fight to the finish, and as Caitlin Ross shows us, for one duo hoping to cross the finish line this year, that struggle is worth every step. Traffic violation. Officer Melinda Lim isn&#39;t going to write Willie Hatchett a ticket. Make sure you get that. But their story spells out inspiration. She cares about the people, the relationship in the community. Willie met Officer Lim on the A JC Peachtree Rd. Race course last year, but he never saw her. And I heard so many great things about her, how she cared for me. He was just a mile into the race when he went down. I collapsed. Collapse mile into the race, Willie suffered cardiac arrest and Officer Lim was the first to respond. Everything was moving, everybody was running, and all of a sudden I see Willie just stop and he just collapsed. Doctors and nurses on the course rushed in to help. We just kept taking turns doing CPR because it was so high. It was so strenuous. After they got Willie into the ambulance, Officer Lim didn&#39;t see him again for months. I was worried about Willie. I I needed to know if he was OK. It was very concerning to me because he was down for so long. When Willie got out of the hospital, the two built a friendship step by step. Willie is a great father. He&#39;s a great friend. He&#39;s a great husband. I have heard nothing but great things about him. Those small steps adding up to a big idea. Officer Liam. Told me if you want to do it. I would do it with you. They plan to walk Peachtree together next week. Their friendship will endure long past the finish line. There&#39;ll be sometimes when I&#39;m having a hard day at work and I forget why I do what I do, and then I remember. I remember Willie. I remember you like you&#39;re one of the reasons why I do what I do. Reporting in Atlanta, Caitlin Ross, 11 Live News and thank goodness she was there. Saved willies life. Truly amazing that they&#39;ll be walking it together. And remember, it is OK to walk if you get overheated. If you don&#39;t feel OK, take a moment, take a breath and walk. Make sure you hydrate that day too. And don&#39;t forget you can hang out with us to watch the race and all of the fun that comes with it. The bands, the Donuts, Some people even drink some beer as they&#39;re running. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t tell. Our special coverage begins Tuesday, the 4th of July. Starting right here at 4:30 AM. I&#39;ll see you out there on the course happening now.

Let me know in the comments? #marta #martaatlanta #busstop #martabus #atlanta #fulton #dekalb #clayco #transit #publictransport #bus ," This is your first look at the new Marta bus stops coming to the city starting this week. Now we all know the classic Marta bus stops. They've been around for years, they have more colors than information. These new stops are going to have route numbers and they're also going to have the terminating location for each route. So you'll know exactly where you're trying to go. And it will also have a QR code linking to Marta's website so you can get service alerts and better plan your trip. Each stop will have a six digit bus stop ID to help better identify the bus stop.

Now for our favorite segment the like to call Grants Game Change. It&#39;s where you&#39;re going
to get to know the Braves in a very short
amount of time. All the info you need
to know right here. Let&#39;s start with your
first game changer. It&#39;s a guy that loved the long ball this weekend. Austin Riley, What&#39;s
here Game changer? Well, he&#39;s a guy who loves hittg streaks over the last week and 1/2 as well and the Braves have been looking for one of those. Austin Riley has been looking fr consistency at the plate
when I talked to him when the homestand began. It seemed like he was figuring , He told me. I&#39;ve been in the ca, I&#39;ve been working on it. I&#39;ve got all hands on deck from all the hitting coaches and minds that you can have on it. And I&#39;ve found the bug, and now it&#39;s about eliminating , getting rid of bad habits. I think he&#39;s done that. We&#39;re seeing him drive the ball. He&#39;s no longer getting
jammed inside, not as many ground balls. That means more extra base hits, more home runs, more base hits. In general, Austin Riley looks like
himself again, and that means a lot to a Braves offense that very much needs him to look like the player he&#39;s been the last couple of years. It&#39;s funny. It&#39;s almost like a guy named Grant told us this. A couple weeks ago that
even though you&#39;re hitting this love, I think I do. That Austin Riley would be there and there he is. He&#39;s doing what he&#39;s supposed t. Now you got another game change. And Travis Darno, he is somebody that has done soe really nice things at the plate. He&#39;s gotten back in with this c. Why is here game changer? You know, he does good
things at the plate. He does good things
behind the plate. He also does good things
behind the scenes. I refer to Travis Darno as a gle guy for this club because since he walked onto the scene in 202, the Braves have always had a nice situation behind the plate. But I feel like he took it to another level off. Defensively, yes. But the trust that this pitching staff has working with him, the way that he welcomed
in Sean Murphy, a guy that&#39;s going to take a lof playing time away from
him and looked at it as more of a
team effort behind the plate and for the
pitching staff, from game planning to
in game adjustments. Travis Darno is involved
in so many things and you can also call
on him to
get a game-winning hit every
once in a while. It doesn&#39;t hurt. I just feel like he&#39;s
a complete package and he gives the brace
a lot of things that some people may not notice. The team notices, I&#39;ll tell you that. Just a great guy off the field . If you&#39;ve ever gotten a chance o talk to him or be around
him at home, OK, One guy who has been a glue, at least I think so. He is Uncle Charlie, the guy that everyone knows cano solid things for this rotation. He&#39;s your game changer. Why 100%? He is a glue guy
for this rotation and that&#39;s why he&#39;s the one thas in here on a $20 million contrao come back for another year becae they believe that he
can set the tone and eat the innings that they n. And this rotations been
tested so many times already and it&#39;s just
now turning
to the. Month of June. But Charlie has pitched at least 5 innings and all ten starts. Nine more strikeouts against the Phillies in the last one. He&#39;s just looked very good. He&#39;s thrown his curveball more than ever and harder than ever, even at age 39. I think he&#39;s got gas in the tan, and the Braves are going to need him to continue doing these this to help some young guys kind of assimilate to pitching every fih day and to help this Braves rotn take this club where
it needs
to take them. You&#39;re right, this is exay why they brought this guy in. He&#39;s proving that every single time he starts. No offense, everybody else, but I think you saved
the best for last, Michael. This is someone
we have been waiting to return since
August of 2020. Seems like he&#39;s going to
do that in Oakland. Why is here a game changer? Because I do think he
could be a literal game changer for this rotation
for this team. We have all been looking
forward
to the over 1000 day odyssey to get Mil Saroka back in the
mix for this team. He was an Allstar. He was a Braves opening day star in 2020 before a twice torn Achilles and myriad other injurs that ended up slowing him down. But now? You sat down with him, you know he&#39;s done the work. He looks like he&#39;s done the wor. And every fifth day it&#39;s startio look like he&#39;s got what
he needs
to help the club cover innings and get . And I&#39;m very excited to see him finally back where he belongs, on a big league mound, resuming A promising career
at just age 25. He&#39;s got some gas in the tank, He&#39;s got some tread on the tire. Let&#39;s see what he can give the Braves for the rest of the seas. Braves fans on Twitter not taking
anything lately when it comes to his
physique as well. He looks huge, he looks
great and Oakland, I think a good place
for him to return. Very good. And I think
it&#39;s one of those. And not just making jokes aboute attendance but he is able
to face a lineup that won&#39;t be the biggest chall. They&#39;re able to kind of spaces starts out I think on the road trip and even coming home. I think he&#39;s just in a really gt spot of the schedule and where e is in his rehab to get back on e mound and finally finally start for the Atlanta Braves. Again going to be unreal to see him in a big league uniform. Grant, always great to see you. Thank you so much. We&#39;ll be right back with our video of the week after the bre.

shot and killed at the East Point Marta stations past weekend. A horrible situatn because he was only 16 years old now his loved ones are now callg for a stop to youth gun violenc. Teresa Boles spoke with the parents and coaches. Jalen Majors loved ones say. He was an athlete, a big smile, and he loved making everyone la. In fact, he used to play on they fields I&#39;m standing on and this senseless act of violence was la gut punch to those
who knew and loved him. Personality was
one of them kind. He could walk in the
room and brighten up any room. Jalen Majora&#39;s
father, Antonio, is holding on to his
memories
of him. His mother, Deandra Simpson, says Jalen had just started a new job at the airport. Normally she dropped
him off herself, but as 16 year olds. You, Jalen, wanted to learn how
to catch the train on his own, not dropping him of. And then I said have a good day, son, I&#39;ll be waiting on to picku up from work, he said. OK, mom. And that was it. Moments later, Jalen Major was shot and killed on the platform of this East Point Marta statio. His former football coach, Mark Forston, is still processing the loss. I was in shock initially. I didn&#39;t want to believe it was him. Jalen&#39;s other former coach, Duane Anderson, echoes Forsten. They described Jalen as charismatic and a star player. Like a family member to me, my heart just dropped. Jaylen was a sophomore
at tri-cities High. His shooter was only 15. Tri-City High School&#39;s alumni president Kay Von Arnold says youth gun violence in Atlanta has got to stop. I could think about was that could easily be my daughter put the guns down. It&#39;s OK to talk. It&#39;s OK to disagree, but it&#39;s also Oo have positive conflict resoluti. And I think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on with our kids. No family plans to bury a 16 year . So the family started a go funde to help with Funeral arrangemen. Their lives, like they&#39;re not en getting a chance to live out thr futures because it&#39;s just a lotf killing on killing with
our young baby.

Tonight begins the first of a series of town hall meetings to introduce Doctor Devon Horton. He could soon be tapped to oversee 93,000 students. Parents, though, say they are ready to ask the tough questions about how he was selected and if he is qualified to lead such a large district. Karis Belger joins us now live from Chamblee High School. So Kira is what concerns are you hearing tonight? Well, currently, the
school district that Doctor Horton is leading in Ills is 14 times smaller than the de Kalb County School District. Parents say that is one concern, but it&#39;s not the only one. De Kalb County parent JD Max sas he doesn&#39;t feel the school distt communicated well before
announcing Dr. Devin Horton as its sole finalit for Superintendent. We&#39;re having to scrounge, you know, look on e Internet, talk to folks and seet information we can find. Right now, Doctor Horton is the Superintendent of the Evanston Skokie School District, just north of Chicago. The student population
there is about 6500. DeKalb County student
population is 93,000, making it the third largest district in the entire state. That jump of what is it, 800% in attendance
and in and budget? I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s even ready for that. For Dalia Turner, president of the Georgia Federation of Teachers, thinks the DeKalb County School Board should have searched longr for candidates with more experi. We don&#39;t think that this is the candidate,
the sole candidate that we should be strapped with. So it&#39;s important to note that n though Doctor Horton is a final, nothing is final just yet. In fact, Georgia law dictates
that the school district has to have
14 days of public input before a final
decision is made. That&#39;s part of what
they&#39;re doing now, with the first of three meetings happening tonight in Chamblee Hh School in order for the public to interact with Doctor Horton. There are two more happening tomorrow at at McNair High Scho. There is one, and then
another
one on Friday at the De Kalb County Sc. Administration building
in Stone Mountain. Alright, Karis, thank you so much.

a good developing story in Atlanta this morning. Asked police are searching for e suspect and a shooting at Martis Ashby station less
than 24 hours ago. This happened at the beginning f afternoon rush hour on Tuesday. Police say one person was shot in the head and died. We don&#39;t know the victims
name as of yet. Now community members say they are heartbroken for the victims family and also concerned aboute violence in their neighborhood. It&#39;s been a long journey
of trying to fight the crime that is plaguinr community over here. He adds tht it&#39;s one community members to help keep the neighborhood safe from violent crime like this. And prior to that deadly shooti, we talked to the Atlanta
Police Department about the city&#39;s homicide rate. They told us it&#39;s down significy from this time last year. Homicides are down 50% from last year as of yesterday morning, investigators being called out to 26 homicides this year. But Apd&#39;s deputy chief tells us they are seeing more kids invold in violent crimes than before. And now, as we&#39;re getting
closer to summer, they&#39;re focusing on gangs, guns and drugs, trying to keep kids out of trouble. Some of these kids lack Father figures in the home, and so they are also looking for that sense of family. We want to stand there together. We&#39;re not just here
to lock people up, we&#39;re here to be mentors, to be Big Brothers, Big Sisters. Deputy Chief Hampton also
emphasized
they see kids breaking into cars
and stealing guns, so one way to prevent some of te violence is to make
sure you keep guns locked up where kids
cannot get
to them.

on the run
after a man was shot and killed
inside a Marta rail station and people
living and working nearby, well, they&#39;re on edge. Yeah, they&#39;re really concerned. The homicide taking place at the Ashby rail station. This is just West of downtown Atlanta. 11 alive. John Sherrick is on that story r us tonight. Gunfire inside Marts Ashby rail station at
the beginning of the crowded afternoon
rush. There was only one person shot during
this incident. Marta police major Matt
Carrier says that that one person was shot
in the concourse. Area just before the turnstilest in the head inside
the station, major carrier reviewing security
camera video, says the gunman disappeared
and passengers rushed to try to help the victi. A man in his 20s, carrier
says, who was dead by the time EMT&#39;s arrived. And everybody is so appalled. Johnny Mills, heartbroken for the victim, for his community, for so many people working and living every day here, trying to create a thriving and safe future for these neighborh. Surrounding martyrs. Ashby Rail station just
West of downtown Atlanta. It&#39;s been a long journy of trying to fight the crime ths plaguing our community
over here.
Nim&#39;s can see with his own eyes
police are correct. Violent crime here is way down compared to this time last year. He sees reflections of this hisc community on the faces of histoc warriors who fought
for it so long ago. And then he worries that for evy step forward they all take now s as if the area takes
a step backwards and we feel for the families tht are involved because it&#39;s on us. To help us. And that could very well have been either one of us. At this time, he means violent crime threateng everyone everywhere in Atlanta. John Sherick, 11, alive news.

ANDREW YOUNG JR. (ŒëŒ¶Œë)! Today, March 12th, we celebrate the 91st birthday of Andrew Jackson Young Jr. (March 12, 1932 in New Orleans, Louisiana); an African-American politician, diplomat, and activist. Beginning his career as a pastor, Young was an early leader in the civil rights movement, serving as executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and a close confidant to Martin Luther King Jr. Young later became active in politics, serving as a U.S. Congressman from Georgia, United States Ambassador to the United Nations in the Carter Administration, and 55th Mayor of Atlanta. Since leaving office, Young has founded or served in many organizations working on issues of public policy and political lobbying. Andrew Young was born to Daisy Young, a schoolteacher, and Andrew Jackson Young, a dentist. Young's father hired a professional boxer to teach Andrew and his brother to defend themselves. In a 1964 interview with author Robert Penn Warren for his book, Who Speaks for the Negro?, Young recalls the tensions of segregation in New Orleans, especially growing up in a fairly well-to-do household. He recalls his parents trying to ""compensate for segregation"" by providing for their children but were reluctant to help less wealthy black communities in the area. Young, attended Dillard University for one year before graduating from Howard University. He then earned a divinity degree from Hartford Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1955. He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Young was appointed to serve as pastor of a church in Marion, Alabama. It was there in Marion that he met Jean Childs, who later became his wife. Young became interested in Mahatma Gandhi's concept of nonviolent resistance as a tactic for social change. He encouraged African Americans to register to vote in Alabama, and sometimes faced death threats while doing so. It was at this time that he became a friend and ally of Martin Luther King Jr. In 1955 he accepted a pastorate at Bethany Congregational Church in Thomasville, Georgia. In 1957, Young and Jean moved to New York City when he accepted a job with the Youth Division of the National Council of Churches. While in New York City, Young regularly appeared on Look Up and Live, a weekly Sunday morning television program on CBS, produced by the National Council of Churches in an effort to reach out to secular youth. Young served as a pastor of the Evergreen Congregational Church in Beachton, Georgia, from 1957 to 1959. In 1960, he joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. No longer satisfied with his work in New York City, Young moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1961 upon the invitation of Bernard Lafayette and worked to register black voters. Young played a key role in the 1963 events in Birmingham, Alabama, serving as a mediator between the white and black communities as they negotiated against a background of protests. In 1964, Young was named executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. As a colleague and friend of Martin Luther King Jr., he was a strategist and negotiator during the Civil Rights Campaigns in Birmingham (1963), St. Augustine (1964), Selma (1965), and Atlanta (1966). He was jailed for his participation in civil rights demonstrations, both in Selma, Alabama, and in St. Augustine, Florida. The movement gained congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Young was with King in Memphis, Tennessee, when King was assassinated in 1968. In 1970, Young ran as a Democrat for the 5th District seat in the US House of Representatives, from Georgia, but was unsuccessful. After his defeat, Rev. Fred C. Bennette Jr. introduced him to Murray M. Silver, an Atlanta attorney, who served as his campaign finance chairman. Young ran again in 1972 and won. He later was re-elected in 1974 and in 1976. During his four-plus years in Congress, he was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and was involved in several debates regarding foreign relations, including the decision to stop supporting the Portuguese attempts to hold on to their colonies in southern Africa. Young also sat on the powerful Rules Committee and the Banking and Urban Development Committee. Young opposed the Vietnam War, helped enact legislation that established the U.S. Institute for Peace, established the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area and negotiated federal funds for MARTA and the Atlanta Highways. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Young to serve as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. Young was the first African American to hold the position. Atlanta city councilman Wyche Fowler won the special election to fill Young's seat in Congress. Although the US and the UN enacted an arms embargo against South Africa, as President Carter's UN ambassador, Young vetoed economic sanctions.

You&#39;ve probably heard the stories from people who say they&#39;re smartwatch saved their life. So can your smartwatch accurately detect heart issues? Today? Jerry Carnes with our verify team has the answer. Among the people who credit their smartphone with saving their life is Rob price of Athens. In 2021, he told us how the electrocardiogram feature on his Apple Watch alerted him to major issues with his heart. They&#39;re all trying to figure out what it was and and several cardiologists were kind of arguing back and forth what it what it was. They admitted me to the hospital, did a bunch of tests. We kind of confirmed that it really was ventricular tachycardia. So how accurate are smart watches at detecting heart issues? Let&#39;s verify. Our sources are the US Food and Drug Administration. A study out of Stanford University and doctors at Johns Hopkins Digital Health Lab, the FDA has approved ECG technology from Apple, Fitbit, and Samsung Galaxy. In a statement, the FDA said that the technology may help millions of users identify health concerns more quickly. Doctors at Johns Hopkins Digital Health Lab say if the devices are worn properly flush against the skin but not too tight, they can accurately detect issues that deserve follow-up. It&#39;s able to detect certain signals. Whether it&#39;s your heart rate that might be too low or might be too high, or it might be in a regular heart rate, atrial fibrillation is a condition that can lead to blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. The Stanford University study, sponsored by Apple, found that the company smartwatch can safely identify heart rate irregularities. Only a handful of Apple Watch owners participating in the study were alerted to an irregular pulse, but in those cases, 84% were suffering from atrial fibrillation at the time. So we can verify. But yes, smartwatches can be an accurate tool in monitoring your heart for issues that should trigger a visit with your doctor. Doctor say it&#39;s important to remember that smart watches can be a good screening tool. The information you get from your smart watch should be provided to your doctor, who could then determine how to follow up. We are dedicated to answering any questions you have. If you see anything or something you want us to verify, send an e-mail. You can also text the word verify to the number there on your screen. That number is 4488576 hundred.

His baby girl is now hooked up to a breathing and feeding machine and while doctors were able to save her, she is still in critical condition. We spoke with the victims family tonight and our Cody Alcorn has their reaction to this arrest. Picked up outside a Barber shop 25 days after DeKalb County police say De Monte Hathcoat shot the woman carrying his baby. If you didn&#39;t want to be with her, why not just leave? Even if you didn&#39;t want nothing to do with that baby, you could have just left. Adrian Rodriguez says she treated heath coats like a son. He called me mom. I opened my door to you because you had nowhere to go. On February 2nd, DeKalb County police say they found Adrian&#39;s daughter, Shania Rodriguez, shot in the Brandon Hill condominium complex. It sits right off old Singleton Lane in Clarkston. You left her on the side of the road. Animal Shania was eight months pregnant. She was rushed to the hospital where doctors were able to deliver her baby girl. However, they could not save her. She&#39;s fighting. She&#39;s fighting as little Emiliani is fighting for her life. Her grandmother says she&#39;s fighting to make sure the justice system does not fail them this time around. Eight years ago on his 13th birthday, while he sleep in the bed. Adrian knows all too well an arrest doesn&#39;t always lead to a conviction. Her sons alleged killer was acquitted of murder in 2017. I&#39;m hoping for justice to. Prevail. It didn&#39;t the first go around. And give me a reason to have faith in the system again. They have. He has to be held accountable. Like, I can&#39;t go through that again where nobody&#39;s held accountable.

county boys missing, lead found in Georgia schools' water, MARTA streetcars to return amid controversy & more.",thanks so much for joining us here on Atlanta news first plus I'm Joy Lim nachron I just wanted to hop on here and ask for your help to keep your eyes out for two little boys I mean they're not so little they're but they're young boys that are missing police want your help their families want your help so if you don't mind please take a good look at at the pictures of these two boys they're both brothers their names are Jeremiah and Rico Hill from Clayton County both left their Riverdale home around 4 30 they this morning and they haven't been seen since 12 year old Jeremiah was last seen wearing a black black jeans and a red black and yellow tie-dye hoodie Rico had on some red pants and a red hoodie as well as an orange beanie and both of these young boys do suffer with some mental health issues so obviously there's a lot of concern about them and making sure that that they're safe if you see them please you can call 9-1-1 you can call Clayton County Police but please do reach out to authorities because of course they're desperately trying to find these young boys and and keep them safe okay if you are a parent you're going to want to listen to this story uh Georgia apparently could be failing to protect your kids health at school at least that's what some are saying because a new study finds that students might be ingesting lead from drinking water drinking water was tested at schools Nationwide and Georgia scored an F in keeping kids safe from lead poisoning according to a report from the environment America research and policy Georgia has no enforceable state laws or regulatory requirements to address lead in schools this report is certainly very very concerning for parents our Atlanta news first reporter Rachel Aragon is asking a lot of questions right now trying to get some answers trying to find out what's being done to change the things and and how our kids are going to be kept safe if they are being kept safe you can watch out for her story on our traditional broadcast Atlanta news first at four o'clock I also want to talk about street cars Marta streetcar service is going to start back up again next week but you know it's not without controversy a planned expansion of the street streetcar route is actually getting some pushback Atlanta news first reporter Zach Summers has a closer look it's a vibrant exciting area to live Fred Duncan loves the convenience of living just Steps From the Lively Atlanta belt line but he strongly opposes Marta's plans to extend the streetcar through his neighborhood and onto the trail it disrupts a historic area a historic district as organizer of old fourth Ward's streetcar impact team Duncan represents more than 350 homeowners along the proposed route they believe the project which could cost upwards of 215 million dollars is a waste of money and will create more traffic issues in the area I don't think a street car anywhere in the United States runs down residential streets they're generally along commercial streets down wider boulevards the 2.5 mile project which is currently in the final design phase would extend Eastward on Edgewood North on to Randolph to Auburn and Irwin then onto the belt line with a final stop at Ponce City Market for the first time we'll be delivering the equity the opportunity the sustainability the mobility that the Beltline project promises Matthew Rau as chair of Beltline rail now he understands the streetcar has some design and operational problems but he believes those issues will improve as the project expands more importantly he says the East extension will connect people across the city to those that say we don't need it I would just say look at the gridlock we've experienced and I would remind everyone that we said we wanted this and we voted with our tax dollars more Marta has generated a half a billion dollars and the money for this project is already there set aside that was our Zach Summers with that story on Margaret's street cars obviously obviously a little bit of controversy there as well as we've been reporting to you former President Jimmy Carter Georgia native has been in hospice care right and a lot of people worried about him but some of his family members and members of the community really trying to just kind of lift his spirits and I wanted to share this with you this is this is nice so his family that's his his grandson James Carter IV tweeting this video of him and his wife with the message we're juggling a lot lately but yesterday my wife and I got to juggle for my grandparents and they loved it so of course you know we're keeping an eye on the Carter family and you know following how the former president is is doing and we encourage you to just stay tuned with us on Atlanta news first and Atlanta news first plus as we keep following any development surrounding his health and of course his family as well okay check out the this image of this Gator this alligator apparently a famous One in fact he has developed his own nickname Flat Creek Floyd he is back in Peachtree City once again apparently he's been in and out of that area over the years hanging out in and around Flat Creek it's the name Flat Creek Floyd he's pretty popular so much so that I guess there's been an issue over the years with people trying to take selfies with the alligator it's not really a good idea it's not safe I regret that I have to tell you that but our Don shipment did capture this video from a distance a safe distance so here's what's interesting here the Department of Natural Resources is not going to remove this alligator even though of course you know alligator attacks can potentially be deadly basically the rationale here seems to be if if he's not bothering us we're not going to bother him so if he's not presenting a threat to the public and the community clearly seems to be fascinated with this alligator he's just going to say exactly where he is and kind of live his life again like I mentioned menuzah capturing some video interviewing some folks around that area to see what they think about Flat Creek and Floyd and just get some more info he's going to share that with you all at Atlanta news first at five o'clock if you want to tune in for

MARTA released details last fall on a plan to extend its streetcar 2.5 miles to Atlanta‚Äôs Beltline.

The first line of the Atlanta Streetcar system was implemented in 2015 and has been a terribly inefficient public transit program since its implementation. 

The numbers speak for themselves:

- The cost of the first 2.7 miles exceeded estimates at $99 million, or $36.7 million a mile, in 2015. In 2023, estimated costs ballooned to between $88 million to $107.5 million a mile for the proposed expansion with total project costs ranging from $176 million to $230 million.
- Even when it was free, ridership was significantly below capacity, and now that the line costs $1 a ride, ridership has sunk to an average of 400 riders a day in 2022. 
- The system has an average traveling speed of 5 mph. Considering the average human walking speed is 2.5 to 4 mph, it‚Äôs not unfair to say Atlanta‚Äôs streetcars are one of the slowest forms of public transportation available.

Rather than an expensive project that will serve a limited area and has limited demand by people living there, we should be looking at solutions that are a better fit for commuters of necessity, will actually reduce car usage within the city and be cost effective for taxpayers.

The Department of Real Estate and Asset Management (DREAM) has two employees, Benjamin Wright, a Central Fulton Building Maintenance Supervisor, and Patrick Ent, a Greater Fulton Building Maintenance Supervisor, along with Department Director Joe Davis, that worked through the entirety of both County holiday periods, responding to facility issues at 16 buildings. Their response included securing the affected plumbing and fire sprinkler systems, facilitating necessary repairs in conjunction with contractors, and providing daily access to restoration contractors. 

The Public Works Department has a total of 14 employees that worked through the holiday weekend and repaired two major water main leaks, one on Marietta Street in Alpharetta and the other on Haynes Bridge Road in Johns Creek, as well as answered over 130 calls from residents with frozen pipes. Staff assisted homeowners with turning off water to their homes to minimize damage to their properties. 

Mr. Coy Dumas, Jr. is a native of the Adamsville community of Atlanta, Georgia and in 1972, joined what was then called Atlanta Transit as a bus operator. As a native of the Westside, he covered the West Atlanta routes and currently operates Route 853 out of the West Lake Station on the Blue Line. MARTA officials estimates that Mr. Dumas has carried approximately 2.8 million passengers on his bus since beginning his career in transit 50 years ago.

Mr. Dumas boasts a spotless driving record over his career and has never had a traffic accident. He is MARTA‚Äôs most veteran bus driver and wears operator badge #1. He's also been a mentor to countless bus operators over the past five decades, leads the Mentorship Program at the Perry Bus Facility, and he's made no plans to retire. 

 In commemoration of his unprecedented 50 years of dedicated service, Mr. Dumas was honored by the MARTA Board of Directors with a MARTA bus wrapped with his photo.

They release a new, clearer photo of the vehicle accused of hitting and killing a little boy just outside the city rec center. Police say this truck take a good look right now. They say it hit and killed 9 year old Jamal Dean outside the Roselle fan Rec Center on Cleveland Ave. earlier this month. This is a red Toyota Tundra with the license plate R MY7151. Jamal&#39;s favorite sport was basketball. He was there at the rec Center there for an event that night he was killed. Witnesses say that truck tried to go around several cars before it hit Jamal. The only details given for the driver is that it was a man with a beard and gold teeth called Atlanta PD if you have any information.

And I I want to be clear that my concern isn&#39;t necessarily whether or not the lights have been budgeted, or whether or not it&#39;s been a bureaucratic delay. The department has refused to adhere to the law passed by the City of Atlanta to install those lights, and they&#39;ve only provided obfuscation and excuses. And have not complied with the law of the City of Atlanta. At the last meeting I asked our city attorney what is the effect of what we pass a law directing a particular apartment to take an action, and the city attorney replied that they had to comply with the law. The Transportation Department, Atlanta dot, has not complied with the law and it&#39;s been more than 18 months. And so I would, I would hope that the issue would be raised, but more so, I would hope that the will of this Council would be recognized and obeyed. And I would also hope that the will of the people of the city of Atlanta that we represent will also be adhered to and obeyed. But the the second question I have, and this is my final issue. Is that I I&#39;m sure I have heard, and I&#39;m sure others have, about there being a shortfall at Marta as it might result in some of our. Sparse funds that we have appointed. Is the committee going to direct an action or how are you all going to call Marta over to ask them to explain or give an accounting or give an explanation? Thank you, customer. Robot it is. I think many of you probably saw an article over the weekend noting the likely I think quote UN quote monumental shortfall for both Clayton County and Atlanta projects. It&#39;s obviously a great concern to me. I presume it&#39;s a great concern to everyone on this body. They are slated to come before us in March for a quarterly report. I&#39;m going to ask they come beforehand before then to to speak to us. OK yeah well they I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll you&#39;ll hold their feet to the fire. But it it this is a tremendous issue because we went many of us did and campaigned and advocated for that additional those additional funds to go toward Marta. And at first blush this seems very very disturbing and I&#39;m looking forward to their explanation because since no one at Marta is directly elected and we are. We have to hold them accountable for the public funds that we entrust to them on behalf of our voters. So, but I look forward to you bringing them over to the committee. Thank you.

I read some very disturbing, very disturbing news article from a credible source from a source that worked at Atlanta and then went to be #2 and Marta 200,000,000 on consultants. I would have got us about 70% of the one on Compton Rd. light rail Real I came into as Vice Chair of Transportation Committee. I&#39;m not just worried about my projects as Vice chair last year, Vice Chair two years. I&#39;m worried by everybody&#39;s projects. I&#39;ve been very strong and firm with wording with Marta and when I heard my colleague sitting next to me, my Council member Julian Bond acts ask the chance for transportation chair and Vice chair to ask Martin to come before March, I stand on that. I think they need to be. At our meeting this Wednesday, I I requested Kylie Greenwood not seeing anybody else. I I, I, I requested President Kali Greenwood come. And I also requested former former Commissioner of Transportation for the City of Atlanta, Josh Rowland come as well because it&#39;s a lot of stuff going on. I&#39;m gonna look confused, right? And I&#39;m look confused. I think I need to ask a few questions because the people in my community, they&#39;re going to ask me questions. When I walk in the community, I like to hear from the horse&#39;s mouth. So. I look forward to this transportation meeting this Wednesday because man, I know the I like the two folks that are coming because they don&#39;t really run from questions, right? So I&#39;m hopeful that they&#39;ll come next week and I&#39;m hopeful that they won&#39;t run from any questions. Thank you. Thank you, councillor Dozier.

Please read the following instructions carefully: Parade Information: The best way to get to the parade is to take Marta to the Civic Center exit. Check in is between 9:30 - 11:00 AM. Per the Pride Parade Committee, anyone arriving later than 11:00 AM may find themselves being placed at the back of the parade and not with our group. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to get there by 11:00 AM. Add extra time into your travel plans for any unexpected delays. We are part of the Political Groups and we're assigned to block 3. When you get off Marta at the Civic Center head to our set-up spot on Bridge-Peachtree St and Baker St. Cherokee County Democrats placement order is 9 and Indivisible GA11 is 10. There are multiple staging areas. You need to find us at the described location. There will be many Atlanta PRIDE Parade volunteers on-hand if you run into any difficulties finding us. You're encouraged to wear Cherokee County Democrats t-shirts, Indivisible t-shirts or candidate t-shirts. Feel free to embellish them with colorful items reflecting Pride. You can carry signs. Make your own sign or bring a candidate sign. You can also pass out candy, however do not throw any items into the crowd. The day of the parade we will post Rain Rose's phone number should you have any questions. HAVE FUN", ,no longer populated,,2022-10-03T12:51:34.000Z,post data removed,,14,1,1,0,,
